      "Arkema was created when French oil major Total restructured its chemicals business. The restructuring was a gradual process that began many years earlier:\n",
      "1850:   Creation of The Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Co. by five Philadelphia Quakers.[5] \n",
      "1957:   The Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Co. changed its name to Pennsalt Chemicals Corp.[5]\n",
      "1969:   Wallace and Tiernan Inc. merged into Pennsalt Chemicals Corp, forming Pennwalt Corp.[5]\n",
      "1971:\tCreation of Aquitaine Total Organico (ATO), a joint Elf-Total subsidiary. Creation of Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann (PCUK).\n",
      "1973:\tCreation of ATO Chimie.\n",
      "1980:\tCreation of Chloé Chimie (40% Elf Aquitaine, 40% Total and 20% Rhône-Poulenc).\n",
      "1983:\tCreation of Atochem - Chemical production in France is reorganized around Atochem, a wholly owned Elf Aquitaine subsidiary incorporating the activities of ATO Chimie, Chloé Chimie and most of PCUK.\n",
      "1989:  Atochem North America Inc. formed from the merger of Pennwalt Corp., M&T Chemicals, and Atochem Inc.[5]\n",
      "1990:\tChemical production is again reorganized in France: Orkem's petrochemicals, styrenics, fertilizers and acrylics businesses are integrated into Atochem, while specialties (resin and paint) move to Total. Acquisition of Montedison's organic peroxide business.\n",
      "1992:\tAtochem becomes Elf Atochem.\n",
      "2000:\tCreation of Atofina by merging TotalFina and Elf's chemical businesses following the two companies’ 1999 merger.\n",
      "2004:\tCreation of Arkema on October 1.\n",
      "2006:\tArkema IPO on the Paris Bourse on May 18 [6]\n",
      "2007:\tArkema sells its agrochemical activities (CEREXAGRI)[7] and its formaldehyde activities [8]\n",
      "2007:\tArkema acquires Coatex company (specialty acrylic polymers)\n",

      "2012:\tArkema acquires Chinese Company Hipro Polymers (producer of bio-Polyamides) and Casda Biomaterials (producer of plant raw materials)[12]\n",
      "2012 : in July, Arkema sold for 1 symbolic euro its vinyl products business segment to the Klesch group for reasons of profitability,[13] but also to recenter its operations exclusively on specialty chemicals. As part of this divestment, Arkema made a 100 million euro cash payment to the Klesch group and took on debts amounting to 470 million euros to help revive the activity. In response to fears of redundancy and to protests from employees at a number of production sites, the trade unions negotiated, with the Arkema management, industrial and social guarantees as well as support measures designed to protect the rights of employees should the Klesch group implement redundancies following their take-over of the vinyl products activities. Hence two trust funds of €20 M were set up to secure compensation payments and the rights of employees of the companies that were sold off.[14]\n",
      "2012 : as part of its strategic refocusing on specialty chemicals, Arkema acquired a new visual identity as well as a new signature \"Innovative Chemistry\".[15]\n",

      " BASF Werk in Ludwigshafen, 1865\n",
      "BASF is an acronym for Badische Anilin- und SodaFabrik (German for ''Baden Aniline and Soda Factory''). It was founded by Friedrich Engelhorn on 6 April 1865 in Mannheim, in the German-speaking state of Baden. Engelhorn had been responsible for setting up a gasworks and street lighting for the town council in 1861. The gasworks produced tar as a by-product, and Engelhorn used this for the production of dyes. BASF was set up in 1865 to produce other chemicals necessary for dye production, notably soda and acids. The plant, however, was erected on the other side of the Rhine river at Ludwigshafen because the town council of Mannheim was afraid that the air pollution from the chemical plant could bother the inhabitants of the town. In 1866, the dye production processes were also moved to the BASF site.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dyes[edit]\n",
      " BASF Werk in Ludwigshafen, 1881\n",
      "The discovery in 1857 by William Henry Perkin that aniline could be used to make intense colouring agents had led to the commercial production of synthetic dyes in England from aniline extracted from coal tar. BASF recruited Heinrich Caro, a German chemist with experience of the dyestuff industry in England, to be the first head of research.[10] Caro developed a synthesis for alizarin (a natural pigment in madder), and applied for a British patent on 25 June 1869. Coincidentally, Perkin applied for a virtually identical patent on 26 June 1869, and the two companies came to a mutual commercial agreement about the process.[9]\n",
      "Further patents were granted for the synthesis of methylene blue and eosin, and in 1880, research began to try to find a synthetic process for indigo dye, though this was not successfully brought to the market until 1897. In 1901, some 80% of the BASF production was dyestuffs.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Soda[edit]\n",
      " BASF main laboratory in Ludwigshafen, 1887\n",
      "Sodium carbonate (soda) was produced by the Leblanc process until 1880 when the much cheaper Solvay process became available. BASF ceased to make its own and bought it from the Solvay company thereafter.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sulfuric acid[edit]\n",
      " Indigo production at BASF in 1890\n",
      "Sulfuric acid was initially produced by the lead chamber process, but in 1890, a unit using the contact process was brought on stream, producing the acid at higher concentration (98% instead of 80%) and a lower cost. This development followed extensive research and development by Rudolf Knietsch, for which he received the Liebig Medal in 1904.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ammonia[edit]\n",
      "The development of the Haber process from 1908 to 1912 made it possible to synthesize ammonia (a major industrial chemical as the primary source of nitrogen), and, after acquiring exclusive rights to the process, in 1913 BASF started a new production plant in Oppau, adding fertilizers to its product range. BASF also acquired and began mining anhydrite for gypsum at the Kohnstein in 1917.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "IG Farben[edit]\n",
      " Company scrip from Badische Anilin- & Soda-Fabrik, 2 Pfennig Gutschein, ca. 1918\n",
      "In 1916, BASF started operations at a new site in Leuna, where explosives were produced during the First World War. On 21 September 1921, an explosion occurred in Oppau, killing 565 people. The Oppau explosion was the biggest industrial accident in German history. Under the leadership of Carl Bosch, BASF founded IG Farben with Hoechst, Bayer, and three other companies, thus losing its independence. BASF was the nominal survivor, as all shares were exchanged for BASF shares before the merger. Rubber, fuels, and coatings were added to the range of products. In 1935, IG Farben and AEG presented the magnetophon – the first tape recorder – at the Radio Exhibition in Berlin.\n",

      "Following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in 1933, IG Farben collaborated with the Nazi regime, profiting from guaranteed volumes and prices, and from the slave labour provided by the government's Nazi concentration camps. BASF (leader of the chemical industry of the IG Farben) built a chemical factory in Auschwitz by the name IG Auschwitz. The chemical factory IG Auschwitz has a width of 3 km and a length of 8 km, resulting in a size of 24 km². It was the largest chemical factory of the world. IG Farben also achieved notoriety owing to its production of Zyklon-B, the lethal gas used to murder prisoners in German Nazi extermination camps during the Holocaust.[12]\n",
      "The Ludwigshafen site was almost completely destroyed during the Second World War and was subsequently rebuilt. The allies dissolved IG Farben in November 1945.\n",
      "Both the Ludwigshafen and Oppau plants were of strategic importance for the war because the German military needed many of their products, e.g., synthetic rubber and gasoline. As a result, they were major targets for air raids. Throughout the war, Allied bombers attacked the plants 65 times.\n",
      "Shelling took place from the autumn of 1943 and saturation bombing inflicted extensive damage. Production virtually stopped by the end of 1944.\n",
      "Due to a shortage of male workers during the war, women were conscripted to work in the factories, and later prisoners of war and foreign civilians. Concentration camp inmates did not work at the Ludwigshafen and Oppau plants.\n",
      "In July 1945, the American military administration confiscated all IG Farben assets. That same year, the Allied Commission decreed that IG Farben should be dissolved. The sites at Ludwigshafen and Oppau were controlled by French authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "BASF refounded[edit]\n",
      "On 28 July 1948, an explosion occurred at a BASF site in Ludwigshafen, killing 207 people and injuring 3818.[13] In 1952, BASF was refounded under its name following the efforts of former Nazi Party member and Third Reich Wehrwirtschaftsführer (war economy leader) Carl Wurster. With the German economic miracle in the 1950s, BASF added synthetics such as nylon to its product range. BASF developed Polystyrene in the 1930s and invented Styropor in 1951.\n",
      "\n",
      "Production abroad[edit]\n",
      "In the 1960s, production abroad was expanded and plants were built in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Following a change in corporate strategy in 1965, greater emphasis was placed on higher-value products such as coatings, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and fertilizers. Following German reunification, BASF acquired a site in Schwarzheide, Eastern Germany, on 25 October 1990. It expanded to Podolsk, Russia, in 2012, and to Kazan in 2013.[14]\n",
      "The company announced the start of a US$10 billion investment project at Zhanjiang, China, in November 2019. This ″Verbund″ site is intended for the production of engineering plastics and TPU. The site would be the third-largest BASF site worldwide, following Ludwigshafen, Germany, and Antwerp, Belgium, and is expected to be operational by 2022.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeovers[edit]\n",
      "In 1968 BASF (together with Bayer AG) bought the German coatings company Herbol. BASF completely took over the Herbol branches in Cologne and Würzburg in 1970. Under new management, the renewal and expansion of the trademark continued. After an extensive reorganisation and an increasing international orientation of the coatings business, Herbol became part of the new founded Deco GmbH in 1997.\n",
      "BASF bought the Wyandotte Chemical Company, and its Geismar, Louisiana chemical plant in the early 1970s.[16] The plant produced plastics, herbicides, and antifreeze. BASF soon tried to operate union-free, having already reduced or eliminated union membership in several other US plants. Challenging the Geismar OCAW union resulted in a labor dispute that saw members locked out from 1984 to 1989 and eventually winning their case. A worker solidarity committee at BASF's headquarters plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany, took donations from German workers to support the American strikers and organized rallies and publicity in support. The dispute was the subject of an academic study[17] The union also exposed major accidental releases of phosgene, toluene and other toxic gases, these being publicized in the local media and through a video, Out of Control.[16][18] A court threw out a $66,700 fine against BASF for five environmental violations as \"too small\".[16]\n",
      "BASF's European coatings business was taken over by AkzoNobel in 1999. BASF bought the Engelhard Corporation for $4.8 billion in 2006. Other acquisitions in 2006 were the purchase of Johnson Polymer and the construction chemicals business of Degussa.\n",
      "The acquisition of Johnson Polymer was completed on 1 July 2006. The purchase price was $470 million on a cash and debt-free basis. It provided BASF with a range of water-based resins that complements its portfolio of high solids and UV resins for the coatings and paints industry and strengthened the company's market presence, particularly in North America.\n",
      "\n",
      " BASF Portsmouth Site in the West Norfolk area of Portsmouth, Virginia, United States. The plant is served by the Commonwealth Railway.\n",
      "The acquisition of Degussa AG's construction chemicals business was completed in 2006. The purchase price for equity was about €2.2 billion. In addition, the transaction was associated with a debt of €500 million.\n",
      "The company agreed to acquire Ciba (formerly part of Ciba-Geigy) in September 2008.[19] The proposed deal was reviewed by the European Commissioner for Competition. On 9 April 2009, the acquisition was officially completed.[20][citation needed]\n",
      "On 19 December 2008, BASF acquired U.S.-based Whitmire Micro-Gen together with U.K.-based Sorex Ltd, Widnes, Great Britain.[21] Sorex is a manufacturer of branded chemical and non-chemical products for professional pest management. In March 2007 Sorex was put up for sale with a price tag of about £100 million.[22]\n",
      "In December 2010, BASF completed the acquisition of Cognis.[23]\n",
      "In May 2015, BASF agreed to sell parts of its pharmaceutical ingredients business to Swiss drug manufacturer Siegfried Holding for a fee of €270 million, including assumed debt.[24]\n",
      "In October 2017, BASF announced it would buy seed and herbicide businesses from Bayer for €5.9 billion ($7 billion), as part of its acquisition of Monsanto.[25][26]\n",
      "In August 2019, BASF agreed to sell its global pigments business to Japanese fine chemical company DIC for €1.15 billion ($1.28 billion) on a cash and debt-free basis.[27]\n",
      "In September 2019, BASF signed an agreement with DuPont Safety & Construction, a subsidiary business unit of DuPont Co., to sell its ultrafiltration membrane business, Inge GmbH.[28] According to BASF executives, Inge Gmbh and its products fit better with DuPont and their business strategy.[28]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dicamba lawsuit[edit]\n",
      "On 27 January 2020, the first-ever lawsuit concerning Dicamba-related products began in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.[29][30] The lawsuit involves a peach farmer who alleged that Dicamba-based herbicides caused significant damage to his crops and trees.[31] It had also been filed in November 2016, when Dicamba was still owned by Monsanto.[32][33][34] On 14 February 2020, the jury involved in the lawsuit ruled against BASF its co-defendant Bayer, which had acquired Monsanto and its products, and found in favor of the peach grower, Bader Farms owner Bill Bader.[35] BASF and Bayer were also ordered to pay Bader $15 million in damages.[36] On 15 February 2020, Monsanto and BASF were ordered to pay an additional $250 million in punitive damages.[37][38]\n",
      "\n",
      "Finances[edit]\n",
      "For the fiscal year 2017, BASF reported earnings of EUR€6.1 billion, with an annual revenue of EUR€64.5 billion, an increase of 12% over the previous fiscal cycle.[39] BASF's shares traded at over €69 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US€63.7 billion in November 2018.[40] In October 2019, BASF reported a drop of operating income for July to September amounting to 24 percent, along with a drop in EBIT earnings of €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion).[41] The US-China trade war as well as uncertainties related to Brexit were identified as contributing factors.[41] However, overall third quarter profit beat expectations as the acquisition of Bayer AG's agrochemical and seed business help to offset some of the effects of the trade war.[42]\n",

      "Production[edit]\n",
      " Ludwigshafen production site at night.\n",
      "BASF's recent success is characterized by a focus on creating resource efficient product lines after completely abandoning consumer products. This strategy was reflected in production by a re-focus towards integrated production sites. The largest such integrated production site is located in Ludwigshafen employing 33,000 people.\n",
      "Integrated production sites are characterized by co-location of many individual production lines (producing a specific chemical), which share an interconnected material flow. Piping is used ubiquitously for volume materials. All production lines use common raw material sourcing and feed back waste resources, which can be used elsewhere (e.g. steam of various temperatures, sulfuric acid, carbon monoxide). The economic incentive for this approach is high resource and energy efficiency of the overall process, reduced shipping cost and associated reduced risk of accidents. Due to the high cost of such an integrated production site, it establishes a high entry barrier for competitors trying to enter the market for volume chemicals.\n",
      "BASF built a new chemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat at a cost of $100 million. This facility has South Asia's first methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) splitter for processing crude MDI. BASF has 8 production facilities in India.[57]\n",
      "BASF SE has succeeded in developing a semi-crystalline polyamide that allows light to pass through largely unhindered. Ultramid Vision combines very high light transmission with low light scattering. This makes it the world's first semi-crystalline polyamide for semi-transparent or transparent components in chemically challenging environments. Additionally, the unique polyamide is UV and temperature resistant, scratch-proof as well as suitable for flame-retardant requirements. Ultramid Vision can be used in various application fields: It recommends itself especially for parts for visual check, illumination or light design. Ultramid Vision presents a versatile alternative to commonly used materials such as amorphous aliphatic polyamides, polycarbonate or styrene-acrylonitrile copolymers.[58]\n",

      "According to the 2020 “Top 100 Polluters Indexes” published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s “Political Economy Research Institute” (PERI), among US corporations, BASF was ranked the #2 largest polluter of water and #4 largest polluter of air in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[59]\n",
      "In 2006 BASF was included in the Climate Leadership Index for their efforts in relation to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.[60]\n",
      "BASF has created filters for wastewater treatment plants that help to reduce emissions.[61][third-party source needed]\n",
      "The BASF Company and Columbia University formed a partnership to further research \"environmentally benign and sustainable energy sources\". The company has recently reported their emissions in 2006 to be \"1.50 million metric tons of waste,\" which is a decrease from previous years. The amount of waste BASF produces has continued to fall.[61]\n",
      "While BASF publishes its environmental information in the US and Europe, Greenpeace has expressed deep concerns at BASF's refusal to release environmental information on its operations in China.[62]\n",
      "In May 2009, a BASF Plant in Hannibal, Missouri, United States, accidentally discharged chromium into the Mississippi River. The local Department of Natural Resources performed tests in December 2009 showing the chromium levels did not exceed regulatory safety limits.[63] BASF worked with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) to resolve questions regarding the elevated level of hexavalent chromium that was detected in the effluent from one of its permitted outfalls into the Mississippi River. The state department of health reviewed the test results and determined that the amounts found were well below recommended public health screening levels.[64]\n",
      "In 2013, BASF reported a spill of several hundred kilogrammes of the chelating agent Trilon-B (tetrasodium Edta) into the river Rhine from BASF's headquarters in Ludwigshafen, Germany.[65]\n",

      "Early history[edit]\n",
      " Founder Herbert Henry Dow\n",
      " Bromine\n",
      "Dow was founded in 1897 by chemist Herbert Henry Dow, who invented a new method of extracting the bromine that was trapped underground in brine at Midland, Michigan.[15] Dow originally sold only bleach and potassium bromide, achieving a bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902.  Early in the company's history, a group of British manufacturers tried to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices.  Dow survived by also cutting its prices and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its product line.[16]  In 1905, German bromide producers began dumping bromides at low cost in the U.S. in an effort to prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe.  Instead of competing directly for market share with the German producers, Dow bought the cheap German-made bromides and shipped them back to Europe. This undercut his German competitors.[17] Even in its early history, Dow set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its product line. Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of agricultural chemicals, elemental chlorine, phenol and other dyestuffs, and magnesium metal.[citation needed]\n",
      "During World War I, Dow Chemical supplied many war materials the United States had previously imported from Germany.  Dow produced magnesium for incendiary flares, monochlorobenzene and phenol for explosives, and bromine for medicines and tear gas.  By 1918, 90 percent of Dow Chemical production was geared towards the war effort.[18]  At this time, Dow created the diamond logo that is still used by the company.[19]  After the war, Dow continued research in magnesium, and developed refined automobile pistons that produced more speed and better fuel efficiency.  The Dowmetal pistons were used heavily in racing vehicles, and the 1921 winner of the Indianapolis 500 used the Dowmetal pistons in his vehicle.[18]\n",
      "In the 1930s, Dow began producing plastic resins, which would grow to become one of the corporation's major businesses. Its first plastic products were ethylcellulose, made in 1935, and polystyrene, made in 1937.[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "Diversification and expansion[edit]\n",
      "From 1940 to 1941, Dow built its first plant in Freeport, Texas to produce magnesium extracted from seawater rather than underground brine.[21] The Freeport plant is Dow's largest site – and the largest integrated chemical manufacturing site in the country.[22] The site grew quickly – with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production.[23] Growth of this business made Dow a strategic business during World War II, as magnesium became important to manufacture lightweight parts for aircraft.[24] Based on 2002–2003 data, the Freeport plants produced 27 billion lbs of product – or 21% of Dow's global production.[25][better source needed] In 1942, Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in Sarnia, Ontario to produce styrene for use in styrene-butadiene synthetic rubber.[26] Also during the war, Dow and Corning began their joint venture, Dow Corning, to produce silicones for military and, later, civilian use.\n",
      "The \"Ethyl-Dow Chemical Co.\" plant at \"Kure's Beach\" NC, the only plant on the East Coast producing bromine from seawater, was attacked by a German U-boat in 1942.[27]\n",
      "In the post-war era, Dow began expanding outside of North America, founding its first overseas subsidiary in Japan in 1952, and in several other nations soon thereafter. Based largely on its growing plastics business, Dow opened a consumer products division beginning with Saran wrap in 1953.[28] Based on its growing chemicals and plastics businesses, Dow's sales exceeded $1 billion in 1964, $2 billion in 1971.[29]\n",

      "Nuclear weapons[edit]\n",
      "From 1951 to 1975, Dow managed the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, Colorado. Rocky Flats was a nuclear weapons production facility that produced plutonium triggers for hydrogen bombs.[30]\n",

      "Main article: Rocky Flats Plant\n",
      "Contamination from fires and radioactive waste leakage plagued the facility under Dow's management. In 1957 a fire burned plutonium dust in the facility and sent radioactive particles into the atmosphere.[30]\n",
      "The Department of Energy transferred management of the facility to Rockwell International in 1975.[30] In 1990, nearby residents filed a class action lawsuit against Dow and Rockwell for environmental contamination of the area; the case was settled in 2017 for $375 million.[31]  According to the Appellate Court, the owners of the 12,000 properties in the class-action area had not proved that their properties were damaged or they had suffered bodily injury.[32]\n",

      "Vietnam War: napalm and Agent Orange[edit]\n",
      " U.S. Army helicopter spraying Agent Orange over agricultural land during the Vietnam War\n",
      "The United States military dropped napalm bombs on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Dow was one of several manufacturers who began producing the napalm B compound under government contract from 1965. After experiencing protests and negative publicity, the other suppliers discontinued manufacturing the product, leaving Dow as the sole provider. The company said that it carefully considered its position, and decided, as a matter of principle, \"its first obligation was to the government\".[33] Despite a boycott of its products by anti-war groups and harassment of recruiters on some college campuses, Dow continued to manufacture napalm B until 1969.[33] The USA continued to drop napalm bombs on North Vietnam until 1973.\n",

      "Main article: Agent Orange\n",
      "Agent Orange, a chemical defoliant containing dioxin, was also manufactured by Dow in New Plymouth, New Zealand, and Midland, Michigan, in the United States for use by the British military during the Malayan Emergency and the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. In 2005, a lawsuit was filed by Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange against Dow and Monsanto Co., which also supplied Agent Orange to the military. The lawsuit was dismissed.[34] In 2012, Monsanto agreed to a $93 million settlement as a result of a case pursued by ex-Monsanto employees and citizens in the city of Nitro, WV. In 1949, a chemical plant in Nitro experienced an explosion that damaged a tank containing 2,4,5-T, one of the composites that is used in the production of Agent Orange. The settlement of the case included $9 million for the cleanup of affected homes in the area, and $84 million to cover the medical monitoring and treatment of people affected by the explosion, as well as legal costs for the claimants. No care has been given for the in state damage done by the Headquarters in Midland, Michigan, and they refuse to give the evidence to the community.[35]\n",

The Bhopal disaster of 1984 occurred at a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide India Ltd., a subsidiary of Union Carbide, 17 years before Dow Chemical Co.'s acquisition. A gas cloud containing methyl isocyanate and other chemicals spread to the neighborhoods near the plant where more than half a million people were exposed to it. More than 27 years after the event, the actual number of fatalities is still unknown.[38] The official immediate death toll was 2,259 and the government of Madhya Pradesh has confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. Others estimate 3,000 died within weeks and another 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases.\n",
      "There are wide variations in the estimated number of individuals permanently disabled by the event. By one independent estimate, 40,000 individuals were left permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness as a result of the disaster. A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.[39] Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. In 2010 eight former executives of Union Carbide India Ltd. were found guilty of death by negligence. Activists sought to have Dow Chemical held responsible for the ongoing cleanup of the site,[40] now under the control of the state government of Madhya Pradesh.\n",

      "DBCP[edit]\n",
      "Until the late 1970s, Dow produced DBCP (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), a soil fumigant, and nematicide, sold under the names the Nemagon and Fumazone.  Plantation workers who alleged that they became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued both Dow and Dole in Latin American courts. The cases were marred by extensive fraud, including the falsification of test results and the recruitment of plaintiffs who had never worked at Dole plantations.[41] While Nicaraguan courts awarded the plaintiffs over $600 million in damages, they have been unable to collect any payment from the companies. A group of plaintiffs then sued in the United States, and, on November 5, 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them $3.2 million. Dole and Dow vowed to appeal the decision.[42] On April 23, 2009 a Los Angeles judge threw out two cases against Dole and Dow due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in Nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company.[43]  The ruling casts doubt on $2 billion in judgments in similar lawsuits.[44]\n",

      "Tax evasion[edit]\n",
      "In February 2013 a federal court rejected two tax shelter transactions entered into by Dow that created approximately $1 billion in tax deductions between 1993 and 2003. In the stated opinion, the Court termed the transactions \"schemes that were designed to exploit perceived weaknesses in the tax code and not designed for legitimate business reasons\".  The schemes were created by Goldman Sachs and the law firm of King & Spalding, and involved creating a partnership that Dow operated out of its European headquarters in Switzerland.[45][46]  Dow stated that it had paid all tax assessments with interest. The case was a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service seeking a refund of the taxes paid.[47] The case was appealed to the 5th Circuit court, where Dow's claims were again rejected.  Dow has petitioned for an en banc hearing by the 5th Circuit, arguing that the decision was contrary to established case law.[48]\n",

      "Price fixing[edit]\n",
      "Dow Chemical was implicated in a price-fixing scheme that inflated the cost of polyurethane for customers. The U.S. Justice Department closed an investigation in 2007, but a class-action lawsuit won at a jury trial in 2013. Dow settled the suit in 2016 for $835 million.[49]\n",

      "In the early 1990s, Dow embarked on a major structural reorganization.[50] The former reporting hierarchy was geographically based, with the regional president reporting directly to the overall company president and CEO. The new organization combines the same businesses from different sites, irrespective of which region they belong (i.e. the vice president for Polystyrene is now in charge of these plants all over the world).[51][52][53]\n",

      "Union Carbide merger[edit]\n",
      "At the beginning of August 1999, Dow agreed to purchase Union Carbide Corp.

      "William S. Stavropoulos served as president and chief executive officer of Dow from 1995 to 2000, then again from 2002 to 2004.[57] He relinquished his board seat on April 1, 2006, having been a director since 1990 and chairman since 2000.

      "\n",
      "Sarnia, Ontario was Dow's first manufacturing site in Canada, located in the Chemical Valley area alongside other petrochemical companies.[62] In 1942, the Canadian government invited Dow to build a plant there to produce styrene (an essential raw material used to make synthetic rubber for World War II). Dow then built a polystyrene plant in 1947. In August 1985, the site accidentally discharged 11,000 litres of perchloroethylene (a carcinogenic dry cleaning chemical) into the St. Clair River, which gained infamy in the media as \"The Blob\", and Dow Canada was charged by the Ministry of the Environment.[63][64] Up to the early 1990s, Dow Canada's headquarters was located at the Modeland Centre, and a new three-story complex called the River Centre was opened up on the Sarnia site in 1993 to house Research and Development.[65] Since then, several plants (Dow terminology for a production unit) on the site have been dismantled, particularly the Basic Chemicals including Chlor Alkali unit whose closure was announced in 1991 and carried out in 1994 which affected nearly half of the site's employees. The Dow Canada headquarters were moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1996, and the Modeland Centre was sold to Lambton County and the City of Sarnia with Dow leasing some office space.  The Dow Fitness Centre was donated to the YMCA of Sarnia-Lambton in 2003. The Sarnia Site's workforce declined from a peak of 1600 personnel in the early 1990s to about 400 by 2002.[66] In the late 1990s, land on the site was sold to TransAlta which built a natural gas power plant that begun operations in 2002 to supply electricity to the remaining Sarnia site plants and facilities, so that Dow could close its older less efficient steam plant (originally coal fired and later burning natural gas).[67] On August 31, 2006, Dow announced that the entire Sarnia site would cease operations at the end of 2008. The Sarnia site had been supplied with ethylene through a pipeline from western Canada but BP officials warned Dow that shipments from the pipeline had to be suspended for safety reasons, and the loss of an affordable supply for the low density polyethylene plant rendered all the other operations at the site non-competitive.[68] The Low-Density Polyethylene and Polystyrene units closed in 2006, followed by the Latex Unit in 2008, and finally the Propylene Oxide Derivatives Unit in April 2009. Dow afterward focused its efforts on the environmental remediation of the vacant site, which was sold to TransAlta.[66] The former site has since been renamed the Bluewater Energy Park, with the River Centre remaining available for lease.[69]\n",

(PIC), a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. In exchange for $9.5 billion, the agreement included Dow selling 50-percent of its interest in five global businesses: polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate plastics, and ethylenamines and ethanolamines.[74] The agreement was terminated by PIC on December 28, 2008.[75]\n",

      "Citing the global recession that began in the latter half of 2008, the Kuwaiti government scuttled the K-Dow partnership on December 28, 2008.[81] The collapse of the deal dealt a blow to Dow CEO Andrew Liveris' vision of restructuring the company to make it less cyclical. However, on January 6, 2009 Dow Chemical announced they were in talks with other parties who could be interested in a major joint venture with the company.[82] Dow also announced they that it would be seeking to recover damages related to the failed joint venture from PIC.[82]\n",
      "After the K-Dow deal collapsed, some speculated that the company would not complete the Rohm & Haas transaction, as the cash from the former transaction was expected to fund the latter.[83] The deal was expected to be finalized in early 2009 and was to form one of the nation's largest specialty chemicals firms in the U.S.[84][85][86] However, on January 26, 2009 the company informed Rohm and Haas that it would be unable to complete the transaction by the agreed upon deadline.[87] Dow cited a deteriorated credit market and the collapse of the K-Dow Petrochemical deal as reasons for failing to timely close the merger. Around the same time, CEO Andrew Liveris said a first- time cut to the company's 97- year- old dividend policy was not \"off the table\". On February 12, 2009, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15/share, down from $0.42 the previous quarter. The cut represented the first time the company had diminished its investor payout in the dividend's 97-year history.[88][89]\n",
      "The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on April 1, 2009.[90] After negotiating the sale of preferred stock with Rohm and Hass' two largest stockholders and extending their one-year bridge loan an additional year, the company purchased Rohm and Haas for $15 billion ($78 a share) on March 9, 2009.[91]\n",

The two figures are executive vice president Romeo Kreinberg, and director and former CFO J. Pedro Reinhard. Dow claims they were secretly in contact with JPMorgan Chase; at the same time, a story surfaced in Britain's Sunday Express regarding a possible leveraged buyout of Dow. The two executives have since filed lawsuits claiming they were fired for being a threat to CEO Liveris, and that the allegations were concocted as a pretext.[92] However, in June 2008 Dow Chemical and the litigants announced a settlement in which Kreinberg and Reinhard dropped their lawsuits and admitted taking part in discussions \"which were not authorized by, nor disclosed to, Dow's board concerning a potential LBO\" and acknowledged that it would have been appropriate to have informed the CEO and board of the talks.[93]\n",

      "Main articles: DuPont and DowDuPont\n",
      "On December 11, 2015, Dow announced that it would merge with DuPont, in an all-stock deal.[105] The combined company, which was known as DowDuPont, had an estimated value of $130 billion, was equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintained their respective headquarters in Michigan and Delaware.[105] Within two years of the merger's closure, DowDuPont was set to split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agriculture, chemical, and specialty product industries.[106] Shareholders of each company held 50% of the combined company.[107] Dow Chemical CEO Andrew N. Liveris became executive chairman of the new entity, while DuPont CEO Edward D. Breen became CEO.[108] In January 2017, the merger was pushed back a second time pending regulatory approvals.[109]\n",
      "The same day, Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning Incorporated's stake in their joint venture Dow Corning for $4.8 billion in cash and a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation.[109]\n",
      "In 2019, DowDuPont de-merged, forming Dow Inc.. The spin-off was completed on April 1, 2019, at which time Dow Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company, and the direct parent company of The Dow Chemical Company.[110][111]\n",
      "\n",
      "Focus on higher margin business[edit]\n",
      "Dow Chemical has begun to shed commodity chemical businesses, such as those making the basic ingredients for grocery bags and plastic pipes, because their profit margins only average 5–10%.[citation needed] Dow is, as of 2015, focusing its resources on specialty chemicals that earn profit margins of at least 20%.[104][112]\n",

      "Areas along Michigan's Tittabawassee River, which runs within yards of Dow's main plant in Midland, were found to contain elevated levels of the cancer-causing chemical dioxin in November 2006. The dioxin was located in sediments two to ten feet below the surface of the river, and, according to The New York Times, \"there is no indication that residents or workers in the area are directly exposed to the sites\".[113]  However, people who often eat fish from the river had slightly elevated levels of dioxin in their blood.[113]  In July 2007, Dow reached an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency to remove 50,000 cubic yards (38,000 m3) of sediment from three areas of the riverbed and levees of the river that had been found to be contaminated.[114]  In November 2008, Dow Chemical along with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality agreed to establish a Superfund to address dioxin cleanup of the Tittabawassee River, Saginaw River and Saginaw Bay.[115]\n",

      "Sale of herbicide business[edit]\n",
      "In December 2015, Dow Chemicals agreed to sell part of its global herbicide business, which had reported falling sales for nearly a year. A portfolio of weed killers known as dinitroanilines was sold to privately held Gowan Company, a family owned company located in Yuma, Arizona, which markets a variety of pesticides to the agricultural and horticultural industries.[116] The global trademarks for Treflan (pesticide)®, which can be sprayed on field corn, cotton and some fruit and vegetables, were included in the sale, as well as a formulation and packaging facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada.[117] Edge (pesticide)®, Team (pesticide)®, Bonalan (pesticide)® and Sonalan (pesticide)®, intellectual property and labels for herbicides based on the molecules trifluralin, benfluralin and ethalfluralin were also included in the sale. Annual grasses and small seeded broadleaf weeds can be controlled with these products in a wide range of crops including cotton, beans, canola, cereals, crucifers, cucurbits, and vegetables. Dinitroanilines, are also known as \"DNA herbicides\", and have been commercialised at least since 1970.[117][118]\n",

      " Superfund site in Uravan\n",
      "In 2003, Dow agreed to pay $2 million, the largest penalty ever in a pesticide case,[121] to the state of New York for making illegal safety claims related to its pesticides. The New York Attorney General's Office stated that Dow AgroSciences had violated a 1994 agreement with the State of New York to stop advertisements making safety claims about its pesticide products. Dow stated that it was not admitting to any wrongdoing, and that it was agreeing to the settlement to avoid a costly court battle.[122][123]\n",
      "According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Dow has some responsibility for 96 of the United States' Superfund toxic waste sites, placing it in 10th place by number of sites.[citation needed] One of these, a former UCC uranium and vanadium processing facility near Uravan, Colorado, is listed as the sole responsibility of Dow.[124][125] The rest are shared with numerous other companies. Fifteen sites have been listed by the EPA as finalized (cleaned up) and 69 are listed as \"construction complete\", meaning that all required plans and equipment for cleanup are in place.[126]\n",
      "In 2007, the chemical industry trade association – the American Chemical Council – gave Dow an award of 'Exceptional Merit' in recognition of longstanding energy efficiency and conservation efforts. Between 1995 and 2005, Dow reduced energy intensity (BTU per pound produced) by 22 percent. This is equivalent to saving enough electricity to power eight million US homes for a year.[127] The same year, Dow subsidiary, Dow Agrosciences, won a United Nations Montreal Protocol Innovators Award for its efforts in helping replace methyl bromide – a compound identified as contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, Dow Agrosciences won an EPA \"Best of the Best\" Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award.[128] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named Dow as a 2008 Energy Star Partner of the Year for excellence in energy management and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.[129]\n",

      "On May 20, 2013, Dow launched the Dow Lab Safety Academy, a website that includes a large collection of informational videos and resources that demonstrate best practices in laboratory safety.[142] The goal of the website is to improve awareness of safety practices in academic research laboratories and to help the future chemical workforce develop a safety mindset. As such, the Dow Lab Safety Academy is primarily geared toward university students. However, Dow has made the content open to all, including those already employed in the chemical industry. The Dow Lab Safety Academy is also available through the Safety and Chemical Engineering Education program, an affiliate of American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE); and The Campbell Institute, an organization focusing on environment, health and safety practices.\n",
      "The Dow Lab Safety Academy is one component of Dow's larger laboratory safety initiative launched in early 2012, following a report from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board[143] that highlighted the potential hazards associated with conducting research at chemical laboratories in academic institutions. Seeking to share industry best practices with academia, Dow partnered with several U.S. research universities to improve safety awareness and practices in the departments of chemistry, chemical engineering, engineering and materials. Through the pilot programs with U.C. Santa Barbara (UCSB), University of Minnesota, and Pennsylvania State University, Dow worked with graduate students and faculty to identify areas of improvement and develop a culture of laboratory safety.\n",

      "Nature conservancy[edit]\n",
      "In January 2011, The Nature Conservancy and The Dow Chemical Co. announced a collaboration[144] to integrate the value of nature into business decision-making. Scientists, engineers, and economists from The Nature Conservancy and Dow are working together at three pilot sites (North America, Latin America, and TBD[145]) to implement and refine models that support corporate decision-making related to the value and resources nature provides. Those ecosystem services include water, land, air, oceans and a variety of plant and animal life. These sites will serve as a “living laboratories”, to validate and test methods and models so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at Dow and hopefully influence the decision-making and business practices of other companies.[146]\n",

      "Exxon Mobil Corporation, stylized as ExxonMobil, is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is the largest direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil,[3] and was formed on November 30, 1999, by the merger of Exxon (formerly the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (formerly the Standard Oil Company of New York). ExxonMobil's primary brands are Exxon, Mobil, Esso, and ExxonMobil Chemical.[4] ExxonMobil is incorporated in New Jersey.[5]\n",
      "One of the world's largest companies by revenue, ExxonMobil from 1996 to 2017 varied from the first to sixth largest publicly traded company by market capitalization.[6][7] The company was ranked third globally in the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2016.[8] ExxonMobil was the tenth most profitable company in the Fortune 500 in 2017.[9] As of 2018, the company ranked second in the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[10] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions. As of March 2019, ExxonMobil's largest shareholders include The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).\n",
      "ExxonMobil[11] is one of the largest of the world's Big Oil companies.[10] As of 2007[update], it had daily production of 3.921 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent); but significantly smaller than a number of national companies. In 2008, this was approximately 3% of world production, which is less than several of the largest state-owned petroleum companies.[12] When ranked by oil and gas reserves, it is 14th in the world—with less than 1% of the total.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels (1,000,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the seventh largest refiner in the world,[16][17][18] a title that was also associated with Standard Oil since its incorporation in 1870.[3][needs update]\n",
      "ExxonMobil had been criticized for its slow response to cleanup efforts after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska,[19] considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills[20] in terms of damage to the environment. ExxonMobil has a history of lobbying for climate change denial and against the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The company has also been the target of accusations of improperly dealing with human rights issues, influence on American foreign policy, and its impact on the future of nations.[21]\n",

      "Main article: Standard Oil\n",
      "Both Exxon and Mobil were descendants of Standard Oil, established by John D. Rockefeller and partners in 1870 as the Standard Oil Company of Ohio. In 1882, it together with its affiliated companies was incorporated as the Standard Oil Trust with Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and Standard Oil Company of New York as its largest companies.[23] The Anglo-American Oil Company was established in the United Kingdom in 1888.[24]  In 1890, Standard Oil, together with local ship merchants in Bremen established Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft (later: Esso A.G.).[25][26]  In 1891, a sale branch for the Netherlands and Belgium, American Petroleum Company, was established in Rotterdam.[27]  At the same year, a sale branch for Italy, Società Italo Americana pel Petrolio, was established in Venice.[28]\n",
      "The Standard Oil Trust was dissolved under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1892; however, it reemerged as the Standard Oil Interests.[23]  In 1893, the Chinese and the whole Asian kerosene market was assigned to Standard Oil Company of New York in order to improve trade with the Asian counterparts.[29]  In 1898, Standard Oil of New Jersey acquired controlling stake in Imperial Oil of Canada.[25]  In 1899, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey became the holding company for the Standard Oil Interests.[23]  The anti-monopoly proceedings against the Standard Oil were launched in 1898.[23]  The reputation of Standard Oil in the public eye suffered badly after publication of Ida M. Tarbell's classic exposé The History of the Standard Oil Co. in 1904, leading to a growing outcry for the government to take action against the company. By 1911, with public outcry at a climax, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States that Standard Oil must be dissolved and split into 34 companies. Two of these companies were Jersey Standard (\"Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey\"), which eventually became Exxon, and Socony (\"Standard Oil Co. of New York\"), which eventually became Mobil.[30]\n",
      "\n",
      "1911 to 1950[edit]\n",
      "Over the next few decades, Jersey Standard and Socony grew significantly. John Duston Archbold was the first president of Jersey Standard. Archbold was followed by Walter C. Teagle in 1917, who made it the largest oil company in the world.[30]  In 1919, Jersey Standard acquired a 50% share in Humble Oil & Refining Co., a Texas oil producer.[23]  In 1920, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[30] In the following years it acquired or established Tropical Oil Company of Colombia (1920), Standard Oil Company of Venezuela (1921), and Creole Petroleum Company of Venezuela (1928).[25]\n",
      "Henry Clay Folger was head of Socony until 1923, when he was succeeded by Herbert L. Pratt. The growing automotive market inspired the product trademark Mobiloil, registered by Socony in 1920.[citation needed]  After dissolution of Standard Oil, Socony had refining and marketing assets but no production activities. For this reason, Socony purchased a 45% interest in Magnolia Petroleum Co., a major refiner, marketer and pipeline transporter, in 1918. In 1925, Magnolia became wholly owned by Socony. In 1926, Socony purchased General Petroleum Corporation of California.[23][30]  In 1928, Socony joined the Turkish Petroleum Company (Iraq Petroleum Company).[30]  In 1931, Socony merged with Vacuum Oil Company, an industry pioneer dating back to 1866, to form Socony-Vacuum.[23][30][31]\n",
      "\n",
      " Socony gas station and store in Connecticut, 1916\n",
      "In the Asia-Pacific region, Jersey Standard has established through its Dutch subsidiary an exploration and production company Nederlandsche Koloniale Petroleum Maatschappij in 1912. In 1922, it found oil in Indonesia and in 1927, it built a refinery in Sumatra.[32]  It had oil production and refineries but no marketing network. Socony-Vacuum had Asian marketing outlets supplied remotely from California. In 1933, Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum merged their interests in the Asia-Pacific region into a 50–50 joint venture. Standard Vacuum Oil Company, or \"Stanvac,\" operated in 50 countries, from East Africa to New Zealand, before it was dissolved in 1962.[23]\n",
      "In 1924, Jersey Standard and General Motors pooled its tetraethyllead-related patents and established the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation.[33]  In 1927, Jersey Standard signed a 25-years cooperation agreement with IG Farben for the coal hydrogenation research in the United States.  Jersey Standard assumed this cooperation to be beneficial as it believed the United States oil reserves to be exhausted in the near future and that the coal hydrogenation would give an access for producing synthetic fuels. It erected synthetic fuel plants in Bayway, Baton Rouge, and Baytown (unfinished). The interest in hydrogenation evaporated after discovery of the East Texas Oil Field.[34]  As a part of the cooperation between Jersey Standard and IG Farben, a joint company, Standard I.G. Company, was established with Jersey Standard having a stake of 80%.  IG Farben transferred rights to the hydrogenation process outside of Germany to the joint venture in exchange of $35 million stake of Jersey Standard shares.[35]  In 1930, the joint company established Hydro Patents Company to license the hydrogenation process in the United States.[36]  The agreement with IG Farben gave to Jersey Standard access to patents related to polyisobutylene which assist Jersey Standard to advance in isobutolene polymerization and to produce the first butyl rubber in 1937.[30][37][38]  As the agreement with IG Farben gave to the German company a veto right of licensing chemical industry patents in the United States, including patent for butyl rubber, Jersey Standard was accused of treason by senator Harry S. Truman.[39]  In 1941, it opened the first commercial synthetic toluene plant.[30]\n",
      "In 1932, Jersey Standard acquired foreign assets of the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company. In 1937, its assets in Bolivia were nationalized, followed by the nationalization of its assets in Mexico in 1938.[30]\n",
      "Since the 1911 Standard Oil Trust breakup, Jersey Standard used the trademark Esso, a phonetic pronunciation of the initials \"S\" and \"O\" in the name Standard Oil,[3] as one of its primary brand names.[40] However, several of the other Standard Oil spinoffs objected to the use of that name in their territories, and successfully got the U.S. federal courts in the 1930s to ban the Esso brand in those states.[41] In those territories where the ban was in force, Jersey Standard instead marketed its products under the Enco or Humble names.[40]\n",
      "In 1935, Socony Vacuum Oil opened the huge Mammoth Oil Port on Staten Island, which had a capacity of handling a quarter of a billion gallons of petroleum products a year and could transship oil from ocean-going tankers and river barges.[42] In 1940, Socony-Vacuum purchased the Gilmore Oil Company of California, which in 1945 was merged with another subsidiary, General Petroleum Corporation.[43]  In 1947, Jersey Standard and Royal Dutch Shell formed the joint venture Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV [nl] for oil and gas exploration and production in the Netherlands.[44]  In 1948, Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum acquired interests in the Arab-American Oil Company (Aramco).[23][45]\n",
      "\n",
      "1950 to 1972[edit]\n",
      "In 1955, Socony-Vacuum became Socony Mobil Oil Company.  In 1959, Magnolia Petroleum Company, General Petroleum Corporation, and Mobil Producing Company were merged to form the Mobil Oil Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Socony Mobil. In 1966, Socony Mobil Oil Company became the Mobil Oil Corporation.[23]\n",
      "Humble Oil became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jersey Standard and was reorganized into the United States marketing division of Jersey Standard in 1959.  In 1967, Humble Oil purchased all remaining Signal stations from Standard Oil Company of California (Chevron) In 1969, Humble Oil opened a new refinery in Benicia, California.[citation needed]\n",
      "In Libya, Jersey Standard made its first major oil discovery in 1959.[23]\n",

In 1969, it created a subsidiary, Jersey Nuclear Company (later: Exxon Nuclear Company), for manufacturing and marketing of uranium fuel, which was to be fabricated from uranium concentrates mined by the mineral department of Humble Oil (later: Exxon Minerals Company).[54]  In 1970, Jersey Nuclear opened a nuclear fuel manufacturing facility, now owned by Framatome, in Richland, Washington.[55]  In 1986, Exxon Nuclear was sold to Kraftwerk Union, a nuclear arm of Siemens.[56][57] The company started surface mining of uranium ore in Converse County, Wyoming, in 1970, solution mining in 1972, and underground mining in 1977. Uranium ore processing started in 1972.

At the same time, the company changed its corporate name from Standard Oil of New Jersey to Exxon Corporation, and Humble Oil became Exxon Company, U.S.A.[23] The rebranding came after successful test-marketing of the Exxon name, under two experimental logos, in the fall and winter of 1971–72. Along with the new name, Exxon settled on a rectangular logo using red lettering and blue trim on a white background, similar to the familiar color scheme on the old Enco and Esso logos.

At the time of the merger, Exxon was the world's largest energy company while Mobil was the second-largest oil and gas company in the United States. The merger announcement followed shortly after the merge of BP and Amoco, which was the largest industrial merger at the time.[72]  Formally, Mobil was bought by Exxon. Mobil's shareholders received 1.32 Exxon's share for each Mobil's share. As a result, the former Mobil's shareholders receives about 30% in the merged company while the stake of former Exxon's shareholders was about 70%. The head of Exxon Lee Raymond remained the chairman and chief executive of the new company and Mobil chief executive Lucio Noto became vice-chairman.[72]  The merger of Exxon and Mobil was unique in American history because it reunited the two largest companies of the Standard Oil trust.[73]\n",

In addition, ExxonMobil should sell its Benicia Refinery in California, terminal operations in Boston, the Washington, D.C. area and Guam, interest in the Colonial pipeline, Mobil's interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, Exxon's jet turbine oil business, and give-up the option to buy Tosco Corporation gas stations.[80][81]  The Benicia Refinery and 340 Exxon-branded stations in California were bought by Valero Energy Corporation in 2000.[82]\n",

ExxonMobil alone produces 2,325,000 bpd or $967,432,500 per year of gross revenue in Iraq to maintain low prices. This practice is considered to be beneficial to the big oil consumer countries and allows Exxon to produce higher profit crude oil products such as plastic, fertilizer, medication, lubricant, and clothing.\n",
      "In 2002, the company sold its stake in the Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia, and copper-mining business in Chile.[62][83]  At the same time, it renewed its interest in oil shale by developing the ExxonMobil Electrofrac in-situ extraction process. In 2014, the Bureau of Land Management approved their research and development project in Rio Blanco County, Colorado.[84][85]  However, in November 2015 the company relinquished its federal research, development and demonstration lease.[86]  In 2009, ExxonMobil phased-out coal mining by selling its last operational coal mine in the United States.[87]\n",

      "Also in September 2016, ExxonMobil successfully asked a U.S. federal court to lift the trademark injunction that banned it from using the Esso brand in various U.S. states. By this time, as a result of numerous mergers and rebranding, the remaining Standard Oil companies that previously objected to the Esso name had been acquired by BP. ExxonMobil cited trademark surveys in which there was no longer possible confusion with the Esso name as it was more than seven decades before. BP also had no objection to lifting the ban.[41] ExxonMobil did not specify whether they would now open new stations in the U.S. under the Esso name; they were primarily concerned about the additional expenses of having separate marketing, letterheads, packaging, and other materials that omit \"Esso\".[109]\n",

      "\n",
      "Main article: ExxonMobil climate change controversy\n",
      "From the late 1970s through the 1980s, Exxon funded research broadly in line with the developing public scientific approach.[161] After the 1980s, Exxon curtailed its own climate research and became a leader in climate change denial.[162][163][164][165] In 2014, ExxonMobil publicly acknowledged climate change risk.[166]  It nominally supports a carbon tax, though that support is weak,[167] and one of the company's lobbyists admitted that ExxonMobil supports it only because it believes the tax will be almost impossible to implement.[168]\n",
      "ExxonMobil funded organizations opposed to the Kyoto Protocol and seeking to influence public opinion about the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.[164] ExxonMobil helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition, which opposed greenhouse gas emission regulation.[162] In 2007 the Union of Concerned Scientists said that ExxonMobil granted $16 million, between 1998 and 2005, towards 43 advocacy organizations which dispute the impact of global warming, and that ExxonMobil used disinformation tactics similar to those used by the tobacco industry in its denials of the link between lung cancer and smoking, saying that the company used many of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue.[169]\n",
      "In 2015, the New York Attorney General launched an investigation whether ExxonMobil's statements to investors were consistent with the company's decades of extensive scientific research.[170][171] In October 2018, based on this investigation, ExxonMobil was sued by the State of New York, which claimed the company defrauded shareholders by downplaying the risks of climate change for its businesses.[172] On March 29, 2016, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the United States Virgin Islands announced investigations. Seventeen attorney generals were cooperating on investigations.[173][174][175]  In June, the attorneys general of the United States Virgin Islands withdrew the subpoena.[176] In December 2019, the New York Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The ruling was written by New York Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager, who concluded that AG's office “failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that ExxonMobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor”.[177]\n",
      "In 2019, InfluenceMap reported that ExxonMobil was among five major oil companies who were collectively spending $195M per year lobbying to block climate change policies.[178] In 2020, the investment arm of the Church of England asked other shareholders to not re-elect ExxonMobil's board at that year's AGM, saying that the firm's response to the climate crisis was \"inadequate\" and that it was \"carrying on as if nothing has changed\".[179] A month later, investment firm BlackRock stated it intended to vote against the re-election of two directors over the company's failure to make progress on environmental changes.[180]\n",
      "ExxonMobil made several climate pledges: reduce methane emissions by 15% and reduce flaring by 25% by the year 2020. Canadian company 'Imperial Oil\" affiliated with Exxon Mobil pledged to reduce carbon intensity by 10% by the year 2023.[181]\n",
      "On August 6, 2021, ExxonMobil's membership in the Climate Leadership Council was suspended after one of the company's lobbyists admitted that he had lobbied several senators to remove or weaken measures in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that were intended to halt climate change.[168][182]\n",

      "In 2004, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection sued ExxonMobil for $8.9 billion for lost wetland resources at Constable Hook in Bayonne and Bayway Refinery in Linden.[187] Although a New Jersey Superior Court justice was believed to be close to a ruling, the Christie Administration repeatedly asked the judge to wait, since they were reaching a settlement with ExxonMobil's attorneys.[188]  On Friday, February 19, 2015, lawyers for the Christie administration informed the judge that a deal had been reached. Details of the $225 million settlement - roughly 3% of what the state originally sought - were not immediately released. Christopher Porrino served as Chief Counsel to the Christie administration from January 2014 through July 2015 and handled negotiations in the case.[189][190]\n",

      "ExxonMobil is the target of human rights violations accusations for actions taken by the corporation in the Indonesian territory of Aceh. In June 2001, a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was filed in the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia under the Alien Tort Claims Act.[191] The suit alleges that the ExxonMobil knowingly assisted human rights violations, including torture, murder and rape, by employing and providing material support to Indonesian military forces, who committed the alleged offenses during civil unrest in Aceh.[192] Human rights complaints involving Exxon's (Exxon and Mobil had not yet merged) relationship with the Indonesian military first arose in 1992; the company denies these accusations and filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which was denied in 2008 by a federal judge.[193] But another federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in August 2009.[194] The plaintiffs are currently[when?] appealing the dismissal.[195] ExxonMobil was ranked as the 12th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in its Arctic operations.[196][197]\n",
      "\n",
      "Geopolitical influence[edit]\n",
      "A July 2012 Daily Telegraph review of Steve Coll's book, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power, says that he thinks that ExxonMobil is \"able to determine American foreign policy and the fate of entire nations\".[21] ExxonMobil increasingly drills in terrains leased to them by dictatorships, such as those in Chad and Equatorial Guinea.[21] Steve Coll describes Lee Raymond, the corporation's chief executive until 2005, as \"notoriously skeptical about climate change and disliked government interference at any level\".[21]\n",
      "The book was also reviewed in The Economist, according to which \"ExxonMobil is easy to caricature, and many critics have done so.... It is to Steve Coll's credit that Private Empire, his new book about ExxonMobil, refuses to subscribe to such a simplistic view.\"  The review describes the company's power in dealing with the countries in which it drills as \"constrained\".  It notes that the company shut down its operations in Indonesia to distance itself from the abuses committed against the population by that country's army and that it decided to drill in Chad only after the World Bank agreed to ensure that the oil royalties were used for the population's benefit.  The review closes by noting that \"A world addicted to ExxonMobil's product needs to look in the mirror before being too critical of how relentlessly the company supplies it.\"[198]\n",
      "In 1937, Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), 23.75 percent owned by Near East Development Corporation (Later renamed ExxonMobil),[199] signed an oil concession agreement with the Sultan of Muscat. IPC offered financial support to raise an armed force that would assist the Sultan in occupying the interior region of Oman, an area that geologists believed to be rich in oil. This led to the 1954 outbreak of Jebel Akhdar War in Oman that lasted for more than 5 years.[200][201]\n",

      "Exxon Valdez oil spill[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Exxon Valdez oil spill\n",
      "The March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the discharge of approximately 11 million US gallons (42,000 m3) of oil into Prince William Sound,[202] oiling 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of the remote Alaskan coastline.\n",
      "The State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council stated that the spill \"is widely considered the number one spill worldwide in terms of damage to the environment\".[202] Carcasses were found of over 35,000 birds and 1,000 sea otters. Because carcasses typically sink to the seafloor, it is estimated the death toll may be 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, and up to 22 killer whales. Billions of salmon and herring eggs were also killed.[203] It had a devastating effect on the local Alaska Native populations, many of which had for centuries relied largely on fishing to survive.[204]\n",
      "As of 2001, oil remained on or under more than half the sound's beaches, according to a 2001 federal survey. The government-created Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council concluded that the oil disappears at less than 4 percent per year, adding that the oil will \"take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely\". Of the 27 species monitored by the council, 17 have not recovered. While the salmon population has rebounded, and the orca whales are recovering, the herring population and fishing industry have not.[205][206][207]\n",
      "Exxon was widely criticized for its slow response to cleaning up the disaster. John Devens, the Mayor of Valdez, has said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate response to the crisis.[208] Exxon later removed the name \"Exxon\" from its tanker shipping subsidiary, which it renamed \"SeaRiver Maritime\". The renamed subsidiary, though wholly Exxon-controlled, has a separate corporate charter and board of directors, and the former Exxon Valdez is now the SeaRiver Mediterranean. The renamed tanker is legally owned by a small, stand-alone company, which would have minimal ability to pay out on claims in the event of a further accident.[209]\n",
      "After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon to pay $5 billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced that amount by half. Exxon appealed further, and on June 25, 2008, the United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to $500 million.[210]\n",
      "In 2009, Exxon still uses more single-hull tankers than the rest of the largest ten oil companies combined, including the Valdez's sister ship, the SeaRiver Long Beach.[211]\n",

      "A study of the spill released by the US Environmental Protection Agency in September 2007 reported[213] that the spill consists of 17 to 30 million US gallons (64,000 to 114,000 m3) of petroleum products from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century.[214] The largest portion of these operations were by ExxonMobil or its predecessors. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill was approximately 11 million US gallons (42,000 m3).[202]  The study reported that in the early 20th century Standard Oil of New York operated a major refinery in the area where the spill is located. The refinery produced fuel oils, gasoline, kerosene and solvents. Naptha and gas oil, secondary products, were also stored in the refinery area. Standard Oil of New York later became Mobil, a predecessor to Exxon/Mobil.[215]\n",

      "On June 14, 2012, a bleeder plug on a tank in the Baton Rouge Refinery failed and began leaking naphtha, a substance that is composed of many chemicals including benzene.[217] ExxonMobil originally reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) that 1,364 pounds of material had been leaked.[citation needed]\n",
      "On June 18, Baton Rouge refinery representatives told the LDEQ that ExxonMobil's chemical team determined that the June 14 spill was actually a level 2 incident classification, which means that a significant response to the leak was required.[218] On the day of the spill the refinery did not report that their estimate of spilled materials was significantly different from what was originally reported to the department. Because the spill estimate and the actual amount of chemicals spilled varied drastically, the LDEQ launched an in-depth investigation on June 16 to determine the actual amounts of chemicals spilled as well as to find out what information the refinery knew and when they knew it.[219]   On June 20, ExxonMobil sent an official notification to the LDEQ saying that the leak had actually released 28,688 pounds of benzene, 10,882 pounds of toluene, 1,100 pounds of cyclohexane, 1,564 pounds of hexane and 12,605 pounds of additional volatile organic compound.[218][219] After the spill, people living in neighboring communities reported adverse health impacts such as severe headaches and respiratory difficulties.[220]\n",

      "A spokesman for ExxonMobil said that the oil is within 10 miles of the spill site. However, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer disputed the accuracy of that figure.[223] The governor pledged that \"The parties responsible will restore the Yellowstone River.\"[224]\n",

      "Early history[edit]\n",
      "Since its establishment in 1985 from facilities belonging to the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), the company grew through stock swaps with Occidental Chemicals and Millennium Chemicals in 1997 which formed Equistar Chemicals of which each entity were partners. Lyondell purchased the outstanding shares from each of its partners to gain total control of Equistar which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lyondell. In 2004, Lyondell purchased Millennium Chemicals in a stock-swap deal at $2.3 billion. In August 2006, Lyondell acquired Citgo's interest in the Lyondell-Citgo Refinery for $2.1 billion, and renamed the facility Houston Refining.\n",
      "Chemical maker Basell Polyolefins purchased Lyondell in December 2007, creating the new company LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A., one of the largest chemical companies in the world at that time. It was owned by Access Industries, a privately held, U.S.-based industrial group. LyondellBasell is the third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the world and is headquartered in Houston and Rotterdam .\n",
      "\n",
      "Expansion[edit]\n",
      " Facility in Houston\n",
      "LyondellBasell's United States operations filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2009 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2010.[10] The company was only under bankruptcy protection for 15 months. Its former parent company, LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A. was replaced by LyondellBasell Industries N.V.[11] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on October 14, 2010.[12]\n",
      "In 2012, 1 Houston Center, the building housing LyondellBasell's Houston headquarters since 1986, was renamed LyondellBasell Tower.[13] In 2014, LyondellBasell announced that it was installing two large cracking furnaces at its Channelview plant, and the following year the company announced it would double production capacity at the Bayport Underwood plant.[14] LyondellBasell acquired the compounding assets of Zylog Plastalloys, an India-based company, in November 2015.[15] The acquisition made LyondellBasell the third largest PP compounds producer in India.[16][17]\n",
      "In June 2016, LyondellBasell announced a factory in Northern China. It was the third facility for LyondellBasell to open in China, following Guangzhou and Suzhou.[18]\n",
      "In September 2016, LyondellBasell announced that it would build a $700 million polyethylene plant at the La Porte manufacturing complex on the Houston Ship Channel that would produce 1.1 billion pounds of polyethylene annually.[19][20] The company started construction on a La Porte plant in May 2017.[21][22]\n",
      "The company completed an expansion of its Corpus Christi ethylene plant in January 2017. The plant's capacity was increased by 50 percent to produce 2.5 billion pounds annually.[23] That same year, Hurricane Harvey hit the United States and affected the company's Texas Gulf Coast operations. The Houston Ship Channel was temporarily closed, which prevented crude tankers from reaching refineries. The La Porte facility was damaged but came back online in late October.[24][25][26]\n",
      "In December 2017, LyondellBasell partnered with Suez, a French water and waste management company, in the first joint venture between a major plastics and chemicals company and a resource management company.[27]\n",
      "LyondellBasell and Odebrecht entered into exclusive talks for LyondellBasell to acquire control of Braskem in June 2018.[28]\n",
      "During July 2018, LyondellBasell announced a partnership with Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany to advance chemical recycling of plastic materials and assist the global efforts towards the circular economy and plastic waste recycling needs. The focus of the venture is to develop a new catalyst and process technology to decompose post-consumer plastic waste, such as packaging, into monomers for reuse in polymerization processes.[29]\n",
      "In August 2018, LyondellBasell finalized their acquisition of A. Schulman Inc. in a $2.25 billion deal.[30] That same month, it broke ground on the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant in Channelview, Texas. The plant is estimated to produce 1 billion pounds of propylene oxide and 2.2 billion pounds of tertiary butyl alcohol annually. LyondellBasell will export the majority of its products via the Houston Ship Channel.[31]\n",
      "LyondellBasell also announced in September that it and its joint partner, Covestro, kicked-off a large investment project in Maasvlakte-Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Circular Steam Project incorporates an innovative technology into the existing production plant, to convert its water-based waste into energy and is an important contribution to the Dutch government's CO2 reduction targets.[32]\n",

      "Philanthropy[edit]\n",
      "LyondellBasell holds an annual Global Care Day, where company employees volunteer for community service projects in 20 countries.[33]\n",
      "LyondellBasell raised $2.7 million for United Way in 2015.[34] In 2016, LyondellBasell raised $2.65 million across its 23 company sites for Victoria County United Way in Texas.[35] At the time, it was the largest donation the organization had received. The following year, the company donated $54,424 to Victoria County United Way to support 18 partner agencies in the surrounding area.[36] In April 2017, LyondellBasell's Corpus Christi complex raised over $78,000 for United Way of the Coastal Bend which would benefit the Greenwood Molina Childcare Center. The complex had raised over $1.2 million in donations for United Way of the Coastal Bend since 1997.[37]\n",
      "LyondellBasell donated $100,000 to the Houston Fire Department in 2017 and also donated to the Italian Red Cross and Stadtfeuerwehrverband Köln (Cologne Firefighters Association) in Germany.[38]\n",
      "In May 2017, LyondellBasell became a corporate partner of the Astros Community Leaders Program which supports community youth baseball and softball leagues.[39]\n",
      "In response to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, LyondellBasell donated food to disaster relief efforts in the Gulf Coast region.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Awards and recognition[edit]\n",
      "The American Chemistry Council recognized LyondellBasell with its Responsible Care Company of the Year award in 2014.[41] In 2015, the American Heart Association recognized LyondellBasell's Cincinnati Technology Center with the Fit-Friendly Worksite Platinum Award. The Fit-Friendly program emphasizes employee health and company culture surrounding physical health.[42]\n",
      "LyondellBasell was named #2 on the list of Top 25 Foreign-owned Chemical Producers by Chemical & Engineering News in both 2015 and 2016.[43] In 2016, Houston Business Journal recognized LyondellBasell as the third largest Houston-based public company.[44]\n",

      "\n",
      "Environmental issues[edit]\n",
      "LyondellBasell's, among other petrochemical facilities at Berre-L'Étang, France, are regularly criticized in the French media[48][49][50] and by local authorities[51][52] for their large-scale flaring activities generating, among other nuisances, giant smoke plumes[49] with lengths reaching dozens of miles.[51]  The concomitant atmospheric pollution includes organic chemical compounds such as carcinogenic benzene, butadiene and toluene.[50]   Not only the nearby cities of Vitrolles, Rognac and Marignane suffer from this pollution,[52] but it is also held responsible for the deterioration of the air quality in the city center of Marseille,[50] at an approximate distance of 20 km from LyondellBasell's facility.\n",
      "Similar concerns were raised about flaring activities on other LyondellBasell sites, e.g. the Corpus Christi facility[53] and the Lake Charles facility.[54]\n",

      "Chemical compound\n",
      "Polyethylene terephthalate (or poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P), is the most common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in fibres for clothing, containers for liquids and foods, and thermoforming for manufacturing, and in combination with glass fibre for engineering resins.\n",
      "It may also be referred to by the brand names Terylene in the UK,[5] Lavsan in Russia and the former Soviet Union, and  Dacron in the US.\n",
      "Bio-PET is the bio-based counterpart of PET.[6][7]\n",
      "The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibres (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand.[8] In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester, whereas the acronym PET is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer after polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\n",
      "PET consists of polymerized units of the monomer ethylene terephthalate, with repeating (C10H8O4) units. PET is commonly recycled, and has the digit 1 (♳) as its resin identification code (RIC).\n",
      "Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500 nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few micrometers) depending on its crystal structure and particle size.\n",
      "The monomer bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct (this is also known as a condensation reaction), or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with methanol as a byproduct.  Polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers (done immediately after esterification/transesterification) with water as the byproduct.\n",

      "Plastic bottles made from PET are widely used for soft drinks (see carbonation). For certain specialty bottles, such as those designated for beer containment, PET sandwiches an additional polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) layer to further reduce its oxygen permeability.\n",
      "Biaxially oriented PET film (often known by one of its trade names, \"Mylar\") can be aluminized by evaporating a thin film of metal onto it to reduce its permeability, and to make it reflective and opaque (MPET). These properties are useful in many applications, including flexible food packaging and thermal insulation (such as space blankets). Because of its high mechanical strength, PET film is often used in tape applications, such as the carrier for magnetic tape or backing for pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes.\n",
      "Non-oriented PET sheet can be thermoformed to make packaging trays and blister packs.[9] If crystallizable PET is used, the trays can be used for frozen dinners, since they withstand both freezing and oven baking temperatures. Both amorphous PET and BoPET are transparent to the naked eye.  Color-conferring dyes can easily be formulated into PET sheet.\n",

      "History[edit]\n",
      "PET was patented in 1941 by John Rex Whinfield, James Tennant Dickson and their employer the Calico Printers' Association of Manchester, England. E. I. DuPont de Nemours in Delaware, United States, first used the trademark Mylar in June 1951 and received registration of it in 1952.[11] It is still the best-known name used for polyester film. The current owner of the trademark is DuPont Teijin Films US, a partnership with a Japanese company.[12]\n",
      "In the Soviet Union, PET was first manufactured in the laboratories of the Institute of High-Molecular Compounds of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1949, and its name \"Lavsan\" is an acronym thereof (лаборатории Института высокомолекулярных соединений Академии наук СССР).[13]\n",
      "The PET bottle was patented in 1973 by Nathaniel Wyeth.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical properties[edit]\n",
      " Sailcloth is typically made from PET fibers also known as polyester or under the brand name Dacron; colorful lightweight spinnakers are usually made of nylon.\n",
      "PET in its natural state is a colorless, semi-crystalline resin. Based on how it is processed, PET can be semi-rigid to rigid, and it is very lightweight. It makes a good gas and fair moisture barrier, as well as a good barrier to alcohol (requires additional \"barrier\" treatment) and solvents. It is strong and impact-resistant. PET becomes white when exposed to chloroform and also certain other chemicals such as toluene.[15]\n",
      "About 60% crystallization is the upper limit for commercial products, with the exception of polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg glass transition temperature to form an amorphous solid.[16] Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.\n",
      "When allowed to cool slowly, the molten polymer forms a more crystalline material. This material has spherulites containing many small crystallites when crystallized from an amorphous solid, rather than forming one large single crystal. Light tends to scatter as it crosses the boundaries between crystallites and the amorphous regions between them. This scattering means that crystalline PET is opaque and white in most cases. Fiber drawing is among the few industrial processes that produce a nearly single-crystal product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intrinsic viscosity[edit]\n",
      "One of the most important characteristics of PET is referred to as intrinsic viscosity (IV).[17]\n",
      "The intrinsic viscosity of the material, found by extrapolating to zero concentration of relative viscosity to concentration which is measured in deciliters per gram (dℓ/g). Intrinsic viscosity is dependent upon the length of its polymer chains but has no units due to being extrapolated to zero concentration. The longer the polymer chains the more entanglements between chains and therefore the higher the viscosity. The average chain length of a particular batch of resin can be controlled during polycondensation.\n",
      "The intrinsic viscosity range of PET:[18]\n",

      "1.00–2.00\n",
      "Drying[edit]\n",
      "PET is hygroscopic, meaning that it absorbs water from its surroundings. However, when this \"damp\" PET is then heated, the water hydrolyzes the PET, decreasing its resilience. Thus, before the resin can be processed in a molding machine, it must be dried. Drying is achieved through the use of a desiccant or dryers before the PET is fed into the processing equipment.\n",
      "Inside the dryer, hot dry air is pumped into the bottom of the hopper containing the resin so that it flows up through the pellets, removing moisture on its way. The hot wet air leaves the top of the hopper and is first run through an after-cooler, because it is easier to remove moisture from cold air than hot air. The resulting cool wet air is then passed through a desiccant bed. Finally, the cool dry air leaving the desiccant bed is re-heated in a process heater and sent back through the same processes in a closed loop. Typically, residual moisture levels in the resin must be less than 50 parts per million (parts of water per million parts of resin, by weight) before processing. Dryer residence time should not be shorter than about four hours. This is because drying the material in less than 4 hours would require a temperature above 160 °C, at which level hydrolysis would begin inside the pellets before they could be dried out.\n",
      "PET can also be dried in compressed air resin dryers. Compressed air dryers do not reuse drying air. Dry, heated compressed air is circulated through the PET pellets as in the desiccant dryer, then released to the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copolymers[edit]\n",
      "In addition to pure (homopolymer) PET, PET modified by copolymerization is also available.\n",
      "In some cases, the modified properties of a copolymer are more desirable for a particular application. For example, cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) can be added to the polymer backbone in place of ethylene glycol. Since this building block is much larger (six additional carbon atoms) than the ethylene glycol unit it replaces, it does not fit in with the neighboring chains the way an ethylene glycol unit would. This interferes with crystallization and lowers the polymer's melting temperature. In general, such PET is known as PETG or PET-G (polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified). It is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection-molded, sheet-extruded or extruded as filament for 3D printing. PETG can be colored during processing.\n",
      "\n",
      " Replacing terephthalic acid (right) with isophthalic acid (center) creates a kink in the PET chain, interfering with crystallization and lowering the polymer's melting point.\n",
      "Another common modifier is isophthalic acid, replacing some of the 1,4-(para-) linked terephthalate units. The 1,2-(ortho-) or 1,3-(meta-) linkage produces an angle in the chain, which also disturbs crystallinity.\n",
      "Such copolymers are advantageous for certain molding applications, such as thermoforming, which is used for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding (\"SBM\"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Production[edit]\n",
      "Polyethylene terephthalate is produced from ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) (C6H4(CO2CH3)2) or terephthalic acid.[19]\n",
      "The former is a transesterification reaction, whereas the latter is an esterification reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dimethyl terephthalate process (DMT)[edit]\n",
      " Polyesterification reaction in the production of PET\n",
      "In dimethyl terephthalate(DMT) process, this compound and excess ethylene glycol are reacted in the melt at 150–200 °C with a basic catalyst. Methanol (CH3OH) is removed by distillation to drive the reaction forward. Excess ethylene glycol is distilled off at higher temperature with the aid of vacuum. The second transesterification step proceeds at 270–280 °C, with continuous distillation of ethylene glycol as well.[19]\n",
      "The reactions are idealized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "First step\n",
      "C6H4(CO2CH3)2 + 2 HOCH2CH2OH → C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2 + 2 CH3OH\n",
      "Second step\n",
      "n C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2 → [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + n HOCH2CH2OH\n",
      "Terephthalic acid process[edit]\n",
      " Polycondensation reaction in the production of PET\n",
      "In the terephthalic acid process, esterification of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid is conducted directly at moderate pressure (2.7–5.5 bar) and high temperature (220–260 °C). Water is eliminated in the reaction, and it is also continuously removed by distillation:[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "n C6H4(CO2H)2 + n HOCH2CH2OH → [(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + 2n H2O\n",
      "Degradation[edit]\n",
      "PET is subject to various types of degradations during processing. The main degradations that can occur are hydrolytic, and probably most important, thermal oxidation. When PET degrades, several things happen: discoloration, chain scissions resulting in reduced molecular weight, formation of acetaldehyde, and cross-links (\"gel\" or \"fish-eye\" formation). Discoloration is due to the formation of various chromophoric systems following prolonged thermal treatment at elevated temperatures. This becomes a problem when the visual expectations for the polymer are very high, such as in packaging applications. The thermal and thermooxidative degradation results in poor processibility characteristics and performance of the material.\n",
      "One way to alleviate this is to use a copolymer. Comonomers such as CHDM or isophthalic acid lower the melting temperature and reduce the degree of crystallinity of PET (especially important when the material is used for bottle manufacturing). Thus, the resin can be plastically formed at lower temperatures and/or with lower force. This helps to prevent degradation, reducing the acetaldehyde content of the finished product to an acceptable (that is, unnoticeable) level. See copolymers, above. Another way to improve the stability of the polymer is to use stabilizers, mainly antioxidants such as phosphites. Recently, molecular level stabilization of the material using nanostructured chemicals has also been considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acetaldehyde[edit]\n",
      "Acetaldehyde is a colorless, volatile substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, it can cause an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300 °C or 570 °F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute to the production of acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antimony[edit]\n",
      "Antimony (Sb) is a metalloid element that is used as a catalyst in the form of compounds such as antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) or antimony triacetate in the production of PET. After manufacturing, a detectable amount of antimony can be found on the surface of the product. This residue can be removed with washing. Antimony also remains in the material itself and can, thus, migrate out into food and drinks. Exposing PET to boiling or microwaving can increase the levels of antimony significantly, possibly above US EPA maximum contamination levels.[20]\n",
      "The drinking water limit assessed by WHO is 20 parts per billion (WHO, 2003), and the drinking water limit in the United States is 6 parts per billion.[21] Although antimony trioxide is of low toxicity when taken orally,[22] its presence is still of concern. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health investigated the amount of antimony migration, comparing waters bottled in PET and glass: The antimony concentrations of the water in PET bottles were higher, but still well below the allowed maximum concentration. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health concluded that small amounts of antimony migrate from the PET into bottled water, but that the health risk of the resulting low concentrations is negligible (1% of the \"tolerable daily intake\" determined by the WHO). A later (2006) but more widely publicized study found similar amounts of antimony in water in PET bottles.[23]\n",
      "The WHO has published a risk assessment for antimony in drinking water.[22]\n",
      "Fruit juice concentrates (for which no guidelines are established), however, that were produced and bottled in PET in the UK were found to contain up to 44.7 μg/L of antimony, well above the EU limits for tap water of 5 μg/L.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Biodegradation[edit]\n",
      "At least one species of bacterium in the genus Nocardia can degrade PET with an esterase enzyme.[citation needed]\n",
      "Japanese scientists have isolated a bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis that possesses two enzymes which can break down the PET into smaller pieces that the bacterium can digest. A colony of  I. sakaiensis can disintegrate a plastic film in about six weeks.[25][26]\n",
      "In April 2020, a French university announced the discovery of a highly efficient, optimized enzyme that outperforms all PET hydrolases reported so far.[27] This discovery may prove to be an important step towards the concept of a circular PET economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety[edit]\n",
      "Commentary published in Environmental Health Perspectives in April 2010 suggested that PET might yield endocrine disruptors under conditions of common use and recommended research on this topic.[28] Proposed mechanisms include leaching of phthalates as well as leaching of antimony.\n",
      "An article published in Journal of Environmental Monitoring in April 2012 concludes that antimony concentration in deionized water stored in PET bottles stays within EU's acceptable limit even if stored briefly at temperatures up to 60 °C (140 °F), while bottled contents (water or soft drinks) may occasionally exceed the EU limit after less than a year of storage at room temperature.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottle processing equipment[edit]\n",
      " A finished PET drink bottle compared to the preform from which it is made. Worldwide, 480 billion plastic drinking bottles were made in 2016 (and less than half were recycled).[30]\n",
      "There are two basic molding methods for PET bottles, one-step and two-step. In two-step molding, two separate machines are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch blow molding.\n",
      "In the second step, the preforms are heated rapidly and then inflated against a two-part mold to form them into the final shape of the bottle. Preforms (uninflated bottles) are now also used as robust and unique containers themselves; besides novelty candy, some Red Cross chapters distribute them as part of the Vial of Life program to homeowners to store medical history for emergency responders.\n",
      "In one-step machines, the entire process from raw material to finished container is conducted within one machine, making it especially suitable for molding non-standard shapes (custom molding), including jars, flat oval, flask shapes, etc. Its greatest merit is the reduction in space, product handling and energy, and far higher visual quality than can be achieved by the two-step system.[citation needed]\n",

      "In 2016, it was estimated that 56 million tons of PET are produced each year.[31] While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, PET bottle recycling is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET has a resin identification code of 1.[32] The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester fiber, strapping, and non-food containers.[32]\n",
      "Because of the recyclability of PET and the relative abundance of post-consumer waste in the form of bottles, PET is rapidly gaining market share as a carpet fiber. Mohawk Industries released everSTRAND in 1999, a 100% post-consumer recycled content PET fiber. Since that time, more than 17 billion bottles have been recycled into carpet fiber.[33] Pharr Yarns, a supplier to numerous carpet manufacturers including Looptex, Dobbs Mills, and Berkshire Flooring,[34] produces a BCF (bulk continuous filament) PET carpet fiber containing a minimum of 25% post-consumer recycled content.\n",
      "PET, like many plastics, is also an excellent candidate for thermal disposal (incineration), as it is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with only trace amounts of catalyst elements (but no sulfur). PET has the energy content of soft coal.\n",
      "When recycling polyethylene terephthalate or PET or polyester, in general three ways have to be differentiated:\n",
      "\n",
      "The chemical recycling back to the initial raw materials purified terephthalic acid (PTA) or dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG) where the polymer structure is destroyed completely, or in process intermediates like bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate\n",
      "The mechanical recycling where the original polymer properties are being maintained or reconstituted.\n",
      "The chemical recycling where transesterification takes place and other glycols/polyols or glycerol are added to make a polyol which may be used in other ways such as polyurethane production or PU foam production[35][36]\n",
      "Chemical recycling of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines of more than 50,000 tons/year. Such lines could only be seen, if at all, within the production sites of very large polyester producers. Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants have been made in the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The two reasons for this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.\n",
      "Mechanical recycling or direct circulation of PET in the polymeric state is operated in most diverse variants today. These kinds of processes are typical of small and medium-size industry. Cost-efficiency can already be achieved with plant capacities within a range of 5000–20,000 tons/year. In this case, nearly all kinds of recycled-material feedback into the material circulation are possible today. These diverse recycling processes are being discussed hereafter in detail.\n",
      "Besides chemical contaminants and degradation products generated during first processing and usage, mechanical impurities are representing the main part of quality depreciating impurities in the recycling stream. Recycled materials are increasingly introduced into manufacturing processes, which were originally designed for new materials only. Therefore, efficient sorting, separation and cleaning processes become most important for high quality recycled polyester.\n",
      "When talking about polyester recycling industry, we are concentrating mainly on recycling of PET bottles, which are meanwhile used for all kinds of liquid packaging like water, carbonated soft drinks, juices, beer, sauces, detergents, household chemicals and so on. Bottles are easy to distinguish because of shape and consistency and separate from waste plastic streams either by automatic or by hand-sorting processes. The established polyester recycling industry consists of three major sections:\n",

      "PET bottle collection and waste separation: waste logistics\n",
      "Production of clean bottle flakes: flake production\n",
      "Conversion of PET flakes to final products: flake processing\n",
      "Intermediate product from the first section is baled bottle waste with a PET content greater than 90%. Most common trading form is the bale but also bricked or even loose, pre-cut bottles are common in the market. In the second section, the collected bottles are converted to clean PET bottle flakes. This step can be more or less complex and complicated depending on required final flake quality. During the third step, PET bottle flakes are processed to any kind of products like film, bottles, fiber, filament, strapping or intermediates like pellets for further processing and engineering plastics.\n",
      "Besides this external (post-consumer) polyester bottle recycling, numbers of internal (pre-consumer) recycling processes exist, where the wasted polymer material does not exit the production site to the free market, and instead is reused in the same production circuit. In this way, fiber waste is directly reused to produce fiber, preform waste is directly reused to produce preforms, and film waste is directly reused to produce film.\n",

      "In general, the following applies: The earlier in the process foreign substances are removed, and the more thoroughly this is done, the more efficient the process is.\n",
      "The high plasticization temperature of PET in the range of 280 °C (536 °F) is the reason why almost all common organic impurities such as PVC, PLA, polyolefin, chemical wood-pulp and paper fibers, polyvinyl acetate, melt adhesive, coloring agents, sugar, and protein residues are transformed into colored degradation products that, in their turn, might release in addition reactive degradation products.[clarification needed][citation needed] Then, the number of defects in the polymer chain increases considerably. The particle size distribution of impurities is very wide, the big particles of 60–1000 μm—which are visible by naked eye and easy to filter—representing the lesser evil, since their total surface is relatively small and the degradation speed is therefore lower. The influence of the microscopic particles, which—because they are many—increase the frequency of defects in the polymer, is relatively greater.\n",
      "Besides efficient sorting, the removal of visible impurity particles by melt filtration processes plays a particular part in this case.\n",

In view of technology there is not just one way to do it. Meanwhile, there are many engineering companies that are offering flake production plants and components, and it is difficult to decide for one or other plant design.

Results are decreased reactivity during re-polycondensation or re-SSP and broadening the molecular weight distribution.\n",

      "Special feature are: Acetaldehyde and oligomers are contained in the pellets at lower level; the viscosity is reduced somehow, the pellets are amorphous and have to be crystallized and dried before further processing.\n",

      "Manufacture of PET-pellets or flakes for bottles (bottle to bottle) and A-PET[edit]\n",
      "This process is, in principle, similar to the one described above; however, the pellets produced are directly (continuously or discontinuously) crystallized and then subjected to a solid-state polycondensation (SSP) in a tumbling drier or a vertical tube reactor. During this processing step, the corresponding intrinsic viscosity of 0.80–0.085 dℓ/g is rebuilt again and, at the same time, the acetaldehyde content is reduced to < 1 ppm.\n",
      "The fact that some machine manufacturers and line builders in Europe and the United States make efforts to offer independent recycling processes, e.g. the so-called bottle-to-bottle (B-2-B) process, such as Next Generation Recycling (NGR), BePET, Starlinger, URRC or BÜHLER, aims at generally furnishing proof of the \"existence\" of the required extraction residues and of the removal of model contaminants according to FDA applying the so-called challenge test, which is necessary for the application of the treated polyester in the food sector. Besides this process approval it is nevertheless necessary that any user of such processes has to constantly check the FDA limits for the raw materials manufactured by themselves for their process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct conversion of bottle flakes[edit]\n",
      "In order to save costs, an increasing number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or cast film mills are working on the direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing an increasing number of polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through polycondensation in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying twin screw extruders, multi-screw extruders or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.\n",
      "With regard to the consumption of PET bottle flakes, the main portion of about 70% is converted to fibers and filaments. When using directly secondary materials such as bottle flakes in spinning processes, there are a few processing principles to obtain.\n",
      "High-speed spinning processes for the manufacture of POY normally need a viscosity of 0.62–0.64 dℓ/g. Starting from bottle flakes, the viscosity can be set via the degree of drying. The additional use of TiO2 is necessary for full dull or semi dull yarn. In order to protect the spinnerets, an efficient filtration of the melt is, in any case is necessary. For the time-being, the amount of POY made of 100% recycling polyester is rather low because this process requires high purity of spinning melt. Most of the time, a blend of virgin and recycled pellets is used.\n",
      "Staple fibers are spun in an intrinsic viscosity range that lies rather somewhat lower and that should be between 0.58 and 0.62 dℓ/g. In this case, too, the required viscosity can be adjusted via drying or vacuum adjustment in case of vacuum extrusion. For adjusting the viscosity, however, an addition of chain length modifier like ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol can also be used.\n",
      "Spinning non-woven—in the fine titer field for textile applications as well as heavy spinning non-woven as basic materials, e.g. for roof covers or in road building—can be manufactured by spinning bottle flakes. The spinning viscosity is again within a range of 0.58–0.65 dℓ/g.\n",
      "One field of increasing interest where recycled materials are used is the manufacture of high-tenacity packaging stripes, and monofilaments. In both cases, the initial raw material is a mainly recycled material of higher intrinsic viscosity. High-tenacity packaging stripes as well as monofilament are then manufactured in the melt spinning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recycling to the monomers[edit]\n",
      "Polyethylene terephthalate can be depolymerized to yield the constituent monomers. After purification, the monomers can be used to prepare new polyethylene terephthalate. The ester bonds in polyethylene terephthalate may be cleaved by hydrolysis, or by transesterification. The reactions are simply the reverse of those used in production.[39]\n",
      "\n",
      "Partial glycolysis[edit]\n",
      "Partial glycolysis (transesterification with ethylene glycol) converts the rigid polymer into short-chained oligomers that can be melt-filtered at low temperature. Once freed of the impurities, the oligomers can be fed back into the production process for polymerization.\n",
      "The task consists in feeding 10–25% bottle flakes while maintaining the quality of the bottle pellets that are manufactured on the line. This aim is solved by degrading the PET bottle flakes—already during their first plasticization, which can be carried out in a single- or multi-screw extruder—to an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.30 dℓ/g by adding small quantities of ethylene glycol and by subjecting the low-viscosity melt stream to an efficient filtration directly after plasticization. Furthermore, temperature is brought to the lowest possible limit. In addition, with this way of processing, the possibility of a chemical decomposition of the hydro peroxides is possible by adding a corresponding P-stabilizer directly when plasticizing.\n",
      "The destruction of the hydro peroxide groups is, with other processes, already carried out during the last step of flake treatment for instance by adding H3PO3.[40] The partially glycolyzed and finely filtered recycled material is continuously fed to the esterification or prepolycondensation reactor, the dosing quantities of the raw materials are being adjusted accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total glycolysis, methanolysis, and hydrolysis[edit]\n",
      "The treatment of polyester waste through total glycolysis to fully convert the polyester to bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2). This compound is purified by vacuum distillation, and is one of the intermediates used in polyester manufacture (see production). The reaction involved is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "[(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + n HOCH2CH2OH → n C6H4(CO2CH2CH2OH)2\n",
      "This recycling route has been executed on an industrial scale in Japan as experimental production.[citation needed]\n",
      "Similar to total glycolysis, methanolysis converts the polyester to dimethyl terephthalate(DMT), which can be filtered and vacuum distilled:\n",
      "\n",
      "[(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + 2n CH3OH → n C6H4(CO2CH3)2\n",
      "Methanolysis is only rarely carried out in industry today because polyester production based on dimethyl terephthalate(DMT) has shrunk tremendously, and many dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) producers have disappeared.[41]\n",
      "Also as above, polyethylene terephthalate can be hydrolyzed to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol under high temperature and pressure. The resultant crude terephthalic acid can be purified by recrystallization to yield material suitable for re-polymerization:\n",
      "\n",
      "[(CO)C6H4(CO2CH2CH2O)]n + 2n H2O →  n C6H4(CO2H)2 + n HOCH2CH2OH\n",

      "Polyurethane (often abbreviated PUR and PU) is a commonly encountered polymer composed of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links. In contrast to other common polymers such as polyethylene and polystyrene, polyurethane is produced from a wide range of starting materials (monomers) and is therefore a class of polymers, rather than a distinct compound. This chemical variety allows for polyurethanes with very different physical properties, leading to an equally wide range of different applications including: rigid and flexible foams, varnishes and coatings, adhesives, electrical potting compounds, and fibres such as spandex and PUL. Of these, foams are the largest single application, accounting for 67% of all polyurethane produced in 2016.[1]\n",
      "Polyurethane polymers are traditionally and most commonly formed by reacting a di- or triisocyanate with a polyol. Since polyurethanes contain two types of monomers, which polymerise one after the other, they are classed as alternating copolymers. Both the isocyanates and polyols used to make polyurethanes contain, on average, two or more functional groups per molecule.\n",
      "Global production in 2019 was some 25 million metric tonnes,[2] accounting for about 6% of all polymers produced in that year. This is a sufficiently high volume for it to be regarded as a commodity plastic.\n",

      " Prof. Otto Bayer in 1952 demonstrating his creation\n",
      "Otto Bayer and his coworkers at IG Farben in Leverkusen, Germany, first made polyurethanes in 1937.[3][4] The new polymers had some advantages over existing plastics that were made by polymerizing olefins or by polycondensation, and were not covered by patents obtained by Wallace Carothers on polyesters.[5] Early work focused on the production of fibres and flexible foams and PUs were applied on a limited scale as aircraft coating during World War II.[5] Polyisocyanates became commercially available in 1952, and production of flexible polyurethane foam began in 1954 by combining toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polyester polyols.  These materials were also used to produce rigid foams, gum rubber, and elastomers. Linear fibers were produced from hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and 1,4-Butanediol (BDO).\n",
      "In 1956, DuPont introduced polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical started selling polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals.[5] In 1960 more than 45,000 metric tons of flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed  polyurethane rigid foams to be used as high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.\n",
      "In 1969, Bayer exhibited an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, such as the fascia and body panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in coefficient of thermal expansion and better thermal stability. This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.\n",
      "Starting in the early 1980s, water-blown microcellular flexible foams were used to mold gaskets for automotive panels and air-filter seals, replacing PVC polymers.  Polyurethane foams have gained popularity in the automotive realm, and are now used in high-temperature oil-filter applications.\n",
      "Polyurethane foam (including foam rubber) is sometimes made using small amounts of blowing agents to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol restricted the use of many chlorine-containing blowing agents, such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, pentane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries. Later, HFC-134a was also banned due to high ODP and GWP readings, and HFC - 141B was introduced in early 2000s as an alternate blowing agent in aforementioned developing nations.[6] 1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) was introduced in early 2000s as an alternate blowing agent in developing nations.[citation needed]\n",

      "Polyurethanes are produced by reacting diisocyanates with polyols,[7][8][9][10][11][12]  in the presence of a catalyst, or upon exposure to ultraviolet light.[13] \n",
      "Common catalysts include tertiary amines, such as DABCO, or metallic soaps, such as dibutyltin dilaurate. The stoichiometry of the starting materials must be carefully controlled as excess isocyanates can trimerise, leading to the formation of rigid polyisocyanurates. The polymer is usually a crosslinked network, such that the item produced can be considered to be a single molecule. Most polyuthethanes are therefore thermosetting polymers and do not melt on heating, although some thermoplastic polyurethanes are produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common application of polyurethane is as solid foams, which requires the presence of a gas, or blowing agent, during the polymerization step. This is commonly achieved by adding water, which reacts with isocyanates to form CO2 gas and an amine, via an unstable carbamic acid group. The amine produced can also react with isocyanates to form urea groups, and as such the polymer will contain both these and urethane linkers. The urea is not very soluble in the reaction mixture and tends to form separate \"hard segment\" phases consisting mostly of polyurea. The concentration and organization of these polyurea phases can have a significant impact on the properties of the foam.[14]\n",

      "The type of foam produced can be controlled by regulating the amount of blowing agent and also by the addition of various surfactants which change the rheology of the polymerising mixture. Foams can be either \"closed-cell\", where most of the original bubbles or cells remain intact, or \"open-cell\", where the bubbles have broken but the edges of the bubbles are stiff enough to retain their shape, in extreme cases reticulated foams can be formed. Open-cell foams feel soft and allow air to flow through, so they are comfortable when used in seat cushions or mattresses. Closed-cell foams are used as rigid thermal insulation. High-density microcellular foams can be formed without the addition of blowing agents by mechanically frothing the polyol prior to use. These are tough elastomeric materials used in covering car steering wheels or shoe soles. \n",
      "The properties of a polyurethane are greatly influenced by the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with many crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.\n",

      "TDI and MDI are generally less expensive and more reactive than other isocyanates. Industrial grade TDI and MDI are mixtures of isomers and MDI often contains polymeric materials. They are used to make flexible foam (for example slabstock foam for mattresses or molded foams for car seats),[15] rigid foam (for example insulating foam in refrigerators) elastomers (shoe soles, for example), and so on. The isocyanates may be modified by partially reacting them with polyols or introducing some other materials to reduce volatility (and hence toxicity) of the isocyanates, decrease their freezing points to make handling easier or to improve the properties of the final polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are used in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light.[16] The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI).\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyols[edit]\n",
      "Polyols are polymers in their own right and have on average two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule. They can be converted to polyether polyols co-polymerizing ethylene oxide and propylene oxide with a suitable polyol precursor.[17] Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional carboxylic acids and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.\n",
      "Polyols for flexible applications use low functionality initiators such as dipropylene glycol (f = 2), glycerine (f = 3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f = 2.75).[18] Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f = 8), sorbitol (f = 6), toluenediamine (f = 4), and Mannich bases (f = 4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide is added to the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups.  Incorporating carbon dioxide into the polyol structure is being researched by multiple companies.   \n",
      "Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.\n",
      "Conventional polyester polyols are based on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols are based on reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.\n",
      "Specialty polyols include polycarbonate polyols, polycaprolactone polyols, polybutadiene polyols, and polysulfide polyols. The materials are used in elastomer, sealant, and adhesive applications that require superior weatherability, and resistance to chemical and environmental attack. Natural oil polyols derived from castor oil and other vegetable oils are used to make elastomers, flexible bunstock, and flexible molded foam.\n",
      "Co-polymerizing chlorotrifluoroethylene or tetrafluoroethylene with vinyl ethers containing hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate have been used to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine–carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.[19]\n",
      "Phosphorus-containing polyols are available that become chemically bonded to the polyurethane matrix for the use as flame retardants. This covalent linkage prevents migration and leaching of the organophosphorus compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bio-derived materials[edit]\n",
      "Interest in sustainable \"green\" products raised interest in polyols derived from vegetable oils.[20][21][22] Various oils used in the preparation polyols for polyurethanes include soybean, cotton seed, neem seed, and castor. Vegetable oils are functionalized by various ways and modified to polyetheramide, polyethers, alkyds, etc. Renewable sources used to prepare polyols may be dimer fatty acids or fatty acids.[23] Some biobased and isocyanate-free polyurethanes exploit the reaction between polyamines and cyclic carbonates to produce polyhydroxurethanes.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Chain extenders and cross linkers[edit]\n",
      "Chain extenders (f = 2) and cross linkers (f ≥ 3) are low molecular weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that play an important role in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit plastic flow of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.[10][25][26][27][28]\n",
      "The choice of chain extender also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They are all suitable for thermoplastic polyurethanes with the exception of ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels.[8] Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.\n",

      "Catalysts[edit]\n",
      "Polyurethane catalysts can be classified into two broad categories, basic and acidic amine. Tertiary amine catalysts function by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the diol component. Alkyl tin carboxylates, oxides and mercaptides oxides function as mild Lewis acids in accelerating the formation of polyurethane. As bases, traditional amine catalysts include triethylenediamine (TEDA, also called DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA), dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), and bis-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ether, a blowing catalyst also called A-99. A typical Lewis acidic catalyst is dibutyltin dilaurate. The process is highly sensitive to the nature of the catalyst and is also known to be autocatalytic.[30]\n",
      "Factors affecting catalyst selection include balancing three reactions: urethane (polyol+isocyanate, or gel) formation, the urea (water+isocyanate, or \"blow\") formation, or the isocyanate trimerization reaction (e.g., using potassium acetate, to form isocyanurate rings). A variety of specialized catalysts have been developed.[31][32][33]\n",
      "\n",
      "Surfactants[edit]\n",
      "Surfactants are used to modify the characteristics of both foam and non-foam polyurethane polymers. They take the form of polydimethylsiloxane-polyoxyalkylene block copolymers, silicone oils, nonylphenol ethoxylates, and other organic compounds. In foams, they are used to emulsify the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and sub-surface voids.[34] In non-foam applications they are used as air release and antifoaming agents, as wetting agents, and are used to eliminate surface defects such as pin holes, orange peel, and sink marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Production[edit]\n",
      "Polyurethanes are produced by mixing two or more liquid streams. The polyol stream contains catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents (when making polyurethane foam insulation) and so on. The two components are referred to as a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The isocyanate is commonly referred to in North America as the 'A-side' or just the 'iso'. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the 'B-side' or as the 'poly'.[citation needed] This mixture might also be called a 'resin' or 'resin blend'. In Europe the meanings for 'A-side' and 'B-side' are reversed.[citation needed] Resin blend additives may include chain extenders, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, blowing agents, pigments, and fillers. Polyurethane can be made in a variety of densities and hardnesses by varying the isocyanate, polyol or additives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Health and safety[edit]\n",
      "Fully reacted polyurethane polymer is chemically inert.[35] No exposure limits have been established in the U.S. by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) or ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists). It is not regulated by OSHA for carcinogenicity.\n",
      "\n",
      " Open-flame test. Top: untreated polyurethane foam burns vigorously. Bottom: with fire-retardant treatment.\n",
      "Polyurethanes are combustible.[36] Decomposition from fire can produce significant amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to nitrogen oxides, isocyanates, and other toxic products.[37] Because of the flammability of the material, it has to be treated with flame retardants (at least in case of furniture), almost all of which are considered harmful.[38][39] California later issued Technical Bulletin 117 2013 which allowed most polyurethane foam to pass flammability tests without the use of flame retardants. Green Science Policy Institute states: \"Although the new standard can be met without flame retardants, it does NOT ban their \n",
      "use. Consumers who wish to reduce household exposure to flame retardants can look for a TB117-2013 tag on furniture, and verify with retailers that products do not contain flame retardants.\"[40]\n",
      "Liquid resin blends and isocyanates may contain hazardous or regulated components. Isocyanates are known skin and respiratory sensitizers. Additionally, amines, glycols, and phosphate present in spray polyurethane foams present risks.[41]\n",
      "Exposure to chemicals that may be emitted during or after application of polyurethane spray foam (such as isocyanates) are harmful to human health and therefore special precautions are required during and after this process.[42]\n",
      "In the United States, additional health and safety information can be found through organizations such as the Polyurethane Manufacturers Association (PMA) and the Center for the Polyurethanes Industry (CPI), as well as from polyurethane system and raw material manufacturers. Regulatory information can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs) and Title 40 (Protection of the Environment). In Europe, health and safety information is available from ISOPA,[43] the European Diisocyanate and Polyol Producers Association.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing[edit]\n",
      "The methods of manufacturing polyurethane finished goods range from small, hand pour piece-part operations to large, high-volume bunstock and boardstock production lines. Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, wait until it cures, then demold the finished part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dispensing equipment[edit]\n",
      "Although the capital outlay can be high, it is desirable to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater–chiller unit is added to control material temperature in order to improve mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer-milled glass fiber and wollastonite.[citation needed]\n",

It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and seating, integral skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.\n",
      "Aluminum is used for tooling that has an EOL in the hundreds of thousands of parts. It is typically used for molding microcellular foam gasketing and cast elastomer parts, and is milled or extruded into shape.\n",
      "Mirror-finish stainless steel is used for tooling that imparts a glossy appearance to the finished part. The heat transfer characteristic of metal tooling is excellent.\n",
      "Finally, molded or milled polypropylene is used to create low-volume tooling for molded gasket applications. Instead of many expensive metal molds, low-cost plastic tooling can be formed from a single metal master, which also allows greater design flexibility. The heat transfer characteristic of polypropylene tooling is poor, which must be taken into consideration during the formulation process.\n",

      "Polyurethanes, especially those made using aromatic isocyanates, contain chromophores that interact with light. This is of particular interest in the area of polyurethane coatings, where light stability is a critical factor and is the main reason that aliphatic isocyanates are used in making polyurethane coatings. When PU foam, which is made using aromatic isocyanates, is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown. It has been generally accepted that apart from yellowing, visible light has little effect on foam properties.[46][47] This is especially the case if the yellowing happens on the outer portions of a large foam, as the deterioration of properties in the outer portion has little effect on the overall bulk properties of the foam itself.\n",
      "It has been reported that exposure to visible light can affect the variability of some physical property test results.[48]\n",
      "Higher-energy UV radiation promotes chemical reactions in foam, some of which are detrimental to the foam structure.[49]\n",

      "Hydrolysis and biodegradation[edit]\n",
      "Polyurethanes may crumble due to hydrolysis. This is a common problem with shoes left in a closet, and reacting with moisture in the air.[50]\n",
      "Microbial degradation of polyurethane is believed to be due to the action of esterase, urethanase, hydrolase and protease enzymes.[51] The process is slow as most microbes have difficulty moving beyond the surface of the polymer. Susceptibility to funguses is better due to their release of extracellular enzymes, which are more able to permeate the polymer matrix. Two species of the Ecuadorian fungus Pestalotiopsis are capable of biodegrading polyurethane in aerobic and anaerobic conditions such as found at the bottom of landfills.[52][53] Degradation of polyurethane items at museums has been reported.[54]\n",
      "Polyester-type polyurethanes are more easily biodegraded by fungus than polyether-type.[55]\n",

      "Royal Dutch Shell plc, commonly known as Shell, is an Anglo-Dutch multinational oil and gas company headquartered in The Hague in the Netherlands. It is incorporated in the United Kingdom as a public limited company.[3][4] It is one of the oil and gas \"supermajors\", and, measured by 2020 revenues, the fifth-largest company in the world. It is the largest based in Europe and is the largest company overall which is not based in either China or the United States.[5][6] In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Shell was ranked as the 21st-largest public company in the world.[7] Shell was first in the 2013 Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies;[8] in that year its revenues were equivalent to 84% of the Dutch national $556 billion GDP.[9] Since then, Shell has dropped to the 5th largest company on the Global 500, but is still the largest non state-owned energy corporation in the world and the second-largest non-American corporation in the world, falling short only to Walmart.[10]\n",
      "Shell is vertically integrated and is active in every area of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, transport, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation, and trading. It also has renewable energy activities, including biofuels,[11] hydrogen[12] and wind.[13] Shell has operations in over 70 countries, produces around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has around 44,000 service stations worldwide.[14][15] As of 31 December 2019, Shell had total proved reserves of 11.1 billion barrels (1.76×109 m3) of oil equivalent.[16] Shell Oil Company, its principal subsidiary in the United States, is one of its largest businesses.[17] Shell holds 50% of Raízen, a joint venture with Cosan, which is the third-largest Brazil-based energy company by revenues and a major producer of ethanol.[18]\n",
      "Shell was formed in 1907 through the merger of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, based in the Netherlands, and the \"Shell\" Transport and Trading Company, based in the United Kingdom. The combined company rapidly became the leading competitor of the American Standard Oil and by 1920 Shell was the largest producer of oil in the world.[19] Shell first entered the chemicals industry in 1929. Shell was one of the \"Seven Sisters\" which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. In 1964 Shell was a partner in the world's first commercial sea transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG).[20] In 1970 Shell acquired the mining company Billiton, which it subsequently sold in 1994 and now forms part of BHP. In recent decades gas has become an increasingly important part of Shell's business[21] and Shell acquired BG Group in 2016, making it the world's largest producer of LNG.[21]\n",
      "Shell has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It had a market capitalisation of £216 billion at the close of trading on 27 June 2019, by far the largest of any company listed on the London Stock Exchange.[22][23] It has secondary listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. There are two types of shares: A (code RDSA) and B (code RDSB). Until its unification in 2005 the firm operated as a dual-listed company, whereby the British and Dutch companies maintained their legal existence but operated as a single-unit partnership for business purposes. The Shell logo is known as the \"pecten\" after the sea shell Pecten maximus, on which its design is based; the current version of the logo was designed by Raymond Loewy in 1971.\n",
      "As of February 2020, Shell's largest shareholder (A and B shares combined as a percent of the company) was the Netherlands Central Institute for Cashless Securities Transactions with 21.19%, ahead of Guaranty Nominees Limited in second with 18.03%, BlackRock Inc with 7.14%, and The Capital Group with 4.99%.[24] According to the CDP Carbon Majors Report 2017, when taking into account its scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions (emissions caused by the public and other companies using its products), Shell was the ninth-largest corporate producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the period 1988–2015.[25] In 2018, Shell announced it hoped to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner.[26][27]: 2  Shell's delay in implementation emissions mitigation strategies was the main subject of the landmark Milieudefensie et al v Royal Dutch Shell.\n",

      " Royal Dutch Petroleum dock in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia)\n",
      " The oil well at Pangkalan Brandan, North Sumatra, is considered to be the origin of the Royal Dutch Shell.\n",
      "The Royal Dutch Shell Group was created in April 1907 through the amalgamation of two rival companies: the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Dutch: Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij) of the Netherlands and the Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited of the United Kingdom.[28] It was a move largely driven by the need to compete globally with Standard Oil.[29] The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was a Dutch company founded in 1890 to develop an oilfield in Pangkalan Brandan, North Sumatra,[30] and initially led by August Kessler, Hugo Loudon, and Henri Deterding. The \"Shell\" Transport and Trading Company (the quotation marks were part of the legal name) was a British company, founded in 1897 by Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted, and his brother Samuel Samuel.[31] Their father had owned an antique company in Houndsditch, London,[32] which expanded in 1833 to import and sell seashells, after which the company \"Shell\" took its name.[28][33][34]\n",
      "For various reasons, the new firm operated as a dual-listed company, whereby the merging companies maintained their legal existence but operated as a single-unit partnership for business purposes. The terms of the merger gave 60 percent stock ownership of the new group to Royal Dutch, and 40 percent to Shell. Both became holding companies for Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, containing the production and refining assets, and Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, containing the transport and storage assets.[35] National patriotic sensibilities would not permit a full-scale merger or takeover of either of the two companies.[35] The Dutch company, Koninklijke Nederlandsche Petroleum Maatschappij at The Hague, was in charge of production and manufacture.[36] The British Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company was based in London, to direct the transport and storage of the products.[36][34]\n",
      "In 1912, Royal Dutch Shell purchased the Rothschilds' Russian oil assets in a stock deal.  The Group's production portfolio then consisted of 53 percent from the East Indies, 29 percent from the Russian Empire, and 17 percent from Romania.[34][37]\n",

      "During the First World War, Shell was the main supplier of fuel to the British Expeditionary Force.[38] It was also the sole supplier of aviation fuel and supplied 80 percent of the British Army's TNT.[38] It also volunteered all of its shipping to the British Admiralty.[38]\n",
      "The German invasion of Romania in 1916 saw 17% of the group's worldwide production destroyed.[38]\n",
      "In 1919, Shell took control of the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company and in 1921 formed Shell-Mex Limited which marketed products under the \"Shell\" and \"Eagle\" brands in the United Kingdom. During the Genoa Conference of 1922 Royal Dutch Shell was negotiations for a monopoly over Soviet oilfields in Baku and Grosny, although the leak of a draft treaty led to breakdown of the talks.[39] In 1929, Shell Chemicals was founded.[38] By the end of the 1920s, Shell was the world's leading oil company, producing 11 percent of the world's crude oil supply and owning 10 percent of its tanker tonnage.[38]\n",
      "Shell Mex House was completed in 1931, and was the head office for Shell's marketing activity worldwide.[38] In 1932, partly in response to the difficult economic conditions of the Great Depression, Shell-Mex merged its UK marketing operations with those of British Petroleum to create Shell-Mex and BP,[40] a company that traded until the brands separated in 1975. Royal Dutch Company ranked 79th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[41]\n",
      "The 1930s saw Shell's Mexican assets seized by the local government.[38] After the invasion of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany in 1940, the head office of the Dutch companies was moved to Curacao.[38] In 1945 Shell's Danish headquarters in Copenhagen, at the time being used by the Gestapo, was bombed by Royal Air Force De Havilland Mosquitoes in Operation Carthage.[42]\n",
      "Around 1952, Shell was the first company to purchase and use a computer in the Netherlands.[43] The computer, a Ferranti Mark 1*, was assembled and used at the Shell laboratory in Amsterdam. In 1970 Shell acquired the mining company Billiton, which it subsequently sold in 1994 and now forms part of BHP Billiton.[44]\n",
      "\n",
      "21st century[edit]\n",
      "In November 2004, following a period of turmoil caused by the revelation that Shell had been overstating its oil reserves, it was announced that the Shell Group would move to a single capital structure, creating a new parent company to be named Royal Dutch Shell plc, with its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), a secondary listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, its headquarters and tax residency in The Hague, Netherlands and its registered office in London. The unification was completed on 20 July 2005 and the original owners delisted their companies from the respective exchanges. On 20 July 2005, the Shell Transport & Trading Company plc was delisted from the LSE,[45] whereas, Royal Dutch Petroleum Company from NYSE on 18 November 2005.[46] The shares of the company were issued at a 60/40 advantage for the shareholders of Royal Dutch in line with the original ownership of the Shell Group.[47]\n",
      "During the 2009 Iraqi oil services contracts tender, a consortium led by Shell (45%) and which included Petronas (30%) was awarded a production contract for the \"Majnoon field\" in the south of Iraq, which contains an estimated 12.6 billion barrels (2.00×109 m3) of oil.[48][49] The \"West Qurna 1 field\" production contract was awarded to a consortium led by ExxonMobil (60%) and included Shell (15%).[50]\n",
      "In February 2010 Shell and Cosan formed a 50:50 joint-venture, Raízen, comprising all of Cosan's Brazilian ethanol, energy generation, fuel distribution and sugar activities, and all of Shell's Brazilian retail fuel and aviation distribution businesses.[51] In March 2010, Shell announced the sale of some of its assets, including its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) business, to meet the cost of a planned $28bn capital spending programme. Shell invited buyers to submit indicative bids, due by 22 March, with a plan to raise $2–3bn from the sale.[52] In June 2010, Royal Dutch Shell agreed to acquire all the business of East Resources for a cash consideration of $4.7 billion. The transaction included East Resources' tight gas fields.[53]\n",
      "Over the course of 2013, the corporation began the sale of its US shale gas assets and canceled a US$20 billion gas project that was to be constructed in the US state of Louisiana. A new CEO Ben van Beurden was appointed in January 2014, prior to the announcement that the corporation's overall performance in 2013 was 38 percent lower than in 2012—the value of Shell's shares fell by 3 percent as a result.[54] Following the sale of the majority of its Australian assets in February 2014, the corporation plans to sell a further US$15 billion worth of assets in the period leading up to 2015, with deals announced in Australia, Brazil and Italy.[55]\n",
      "Royal Dutch Shell announced on 8 April 2015 it had agreed to buy BG Group for £47 billion (US$70 billion), subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.[56] The acquisition was completed in February 2016, resulting in Shell surpassing Chevron Corporation and becoming the world's second largest non-state oil company.[57]\n",
      "On 7 June 2016, Royal Dutch Shell announced that it would build an ethane cracker plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after spending several years doing an environmental cleanup of the proposed plant's site.[58]\n",
      "In January 2017, Royal Dutch Shell agreed to sell £2.46bn worth of North Sea assets to oil exploration firm Chrysaor.[59] In 2017, Shell sold its oil sands assets to Canadian Natural Resources in exchange of approximately 8.8% stake in that company. In May 2017, it was reported that Shell plans to sell its shares in Canadian Natural Resources fully exiting the oil sands business.[60]\n",
      "On 30 April 2020, Royal Dutch Shell announced that it would cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War, due to the oil price collapse following the reduction in oil demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shell stated that their net income adjusted for the cost of supply dropped to US$2.9 billion in three months to 31 March. This compared with US$5.3 billion in the same period the previous year.[61] On 30 September 2020, the company said that it would cut up to 9,000 jobs as a result of the economic effects caused by the pandemic and announced a \"broad restructuring\".[62] In December 2020, Royal Dutch Shell forecast another write-down of $3.5-4.5 billion for the fourth quarter due to lower oil prices, following $16.8 billion of impairment in the second quarter.[63]\n",
      "In February 2021, Royal Dutch Shell announced a loss of $21.7 billion in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[64] despite reducing its operating expenses by 12%, or $4.5 billion, according to a Morningstar analysis cited by Barron's.[65][66]\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental record[edit]\n",
      "The presence of companies like Shell has led to extreme environmental issues in the Niger Delta. Many pipelines in the Niger Delta owned by Shell are old and corroded. Shell has acknowledged its responsibility for keeping the pipelines new but has also denied responsibility for environmental causes.[67] This has led to mass protests from the Niger Delta inhabitants, Amnesty International, and Friends of the Earth the Netherlands against Shell. It has also led to action plans to boycott Shell by environmental groups, and human rights groups.[68] In January 2013, a Dutch court rejected four out of five allegations brought against the firm over oil pollution in the Niger Delta but found a subsidiary guilty of one case of pollution, ordering compensation to be paid to a Nigerian farmer.[69]\n",
      "On 15 January 1999, off the Argentinian town of Magdalena, Buenos Aires, the Shell tanker Estrella Pampeana collided with a German freighter, emptying its contents into the lake, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals. Over a decade after the spill, a referendum held in Magdalena determined the acceptance of a US$9.5 million compensatory payout from Shell.[70] Shell denied responsibility for the spill, but an Argentine court ruled in 2002 that the corporation was responsible.[71]\n",

      "The name Shell is linked to The \"Shell\" Transport and Trading Company.[88] In 1833, the founder's father, Marcus Samuel Sr., founded an import business to sell seashells to London collectors. When collecting seashell specimens in the Caspian Sea area in 1892, the younger Samuel realised there was potential in exporting lamp oil from the region and commissioned the world's first purpose-built oil tanker, the Murex (Latin for a type of snail shell), to enter this market; by 1907 the company had a fleet. Although for several decades the company had a refinery at Shell Haven on the Thames, there is no evidence of this having provided the name.[89]\n",
      "The Shell logo is one of the most familiar commercial symbols in the world. This logo is known as the \"pecten\" after the sea shell Pecten maximus (the giant scallop), on which its design is based. The yellow and red colours used are thought[90] to relate to the colours of the flag of Spain, as Shell built early service stations in California, previously a Spanish colony. The current revision of the logo was designed by Raymond Loewy in 1971.[91]\n",
      "The slash was removed from the name \"Royal Dutch/Shell\" in 2005, concurrent with moves to merge the two legally separate companies (Royal Dutch and Shell) to the single legal entity which exists today.[92]\n",

      " Oil platform\n",
      "Shell is organised into four major business groupings:[93]\n",
      "\n",
      "Upstream – manages the upstream business. It searches for and recovers crude oil and natural gas and operates the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver oil and gas to the market. Its activities are organised primarily within geographic units, although there are some activities that are managed across the business or provided through support units.\n",
      "Integrated Gas and New Energies – manages to liquefy natural gas, converting gas to liquids and low-carbon opportunities.\n",
      "Downstream – manages Shell's manufacturing, distribution, and marketing activities for oil products and chemicals. Manufacturing and supply include refinery, supply, and shipping of crude oil.\n",
      "Projects and technology – manages the delivery of Shell's major projects, provides technical services and technology capability covering both upstream and downstream activities. It is also responsible for providing functional leadership across Shell in the areas of health, safety and environment, and contracting and procurement.\n",
      "Oil and gas activities[edit]\n",
      " Former Shell oil depot in Kowloon, Hong Kong, around the mid-1980s\n",
      "Shell's primary business is the management of a vertically integrated oil company. The development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration, from the initial search for oil (exploration) through its harvesting (production), transportation, refining and finally trading and marketing established the core competencies on which the company was founded. Similar competencies were required for natural gas, which has become one of the most important businesses in which Shell is involved, and which contributes a significant proportion of the company's profits. While the vertically integrated business model provided significant economies of scale and barriers to entry, each business now seeks to be a self-supporting unit without subsidies from other parts of the company.[94]\n",
      "Traditionally, Shell was a heavily decentralised business worldwide (especially in the downstream) with companies in over 100 countries, each of which operated with a high degree of independence. The upstream tended to be far more centralised with much of the technical and financial direction coming from the central offices in The Hague. The upstream oil sector is also commonly known as the \"exploration and production\" sector.[95]\n",
      "Downstream operations, which now also includes the chemicals business, generate the majority of Shell's profits worldwide and is known for its global network of more than 40,000 petrol stations and its various oil refineries. The downstream business, which in some countries also included oil refining, generally included a retail petrol station network, lubricants manufacture and marketing, industrial fuel and lubricants sales, and a host of other product/market sectors such as LPG and bitumen. The practice in Shell was that these businesses were essentially local and that they were best managed by local \"operating companies\" – often with middle and senior management reinforced by expatriates.[96]\n",
      "\n",
      "Sponsorships[edit]\n",
      "Shell has a long history of motorsport sponsorship, most notably Scuderia Ferrari (1951–1964, 1966–1973 and 1996-present), BRM (1962–1966 and 1968–1972), Scuderia Toro Rosso (2007–2013 and 2016), McLaren (1967–1968 and 1984–1994), Lotus (1968–1971), Ducati Corse (since 1999), Team Penske (2011–present), Hyundai Motorsport (since 2005), AF Corse, Risi Competizione, BMW Motorsport (2015–2019 with also Pennzoil) and Dick Johnson Racing (1987-2004 and 2017–present).[97]\n",

      "Shell began drilling for oil in Africa during the 1950s. Shell operates in the upstream oil sector in Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Gabon (where the Rabi-Kounga oil field is found), Ghana, Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia; and in the downstream sector in 16 other countries.[98] In April 2010, Shell announced its intention to divest from downstream business of all African countries except South Africa and Egypt to Vitol and \"Helios\".[99] In several countries such as Tunisia, protests and strikes broke out. Shell denied rumours of the sellout.[100]\n",

In June 2013, the company announced a strategic review of its operations in Nigeria, hinting that assets could be divested.[103][104] In August 2014, the company disclosed it was in the process of finalizing the sale of its interests in four Nigerian oil fields.[105] On 29 January 2021 a Dutch court ruled that Shell was responsible for multiple oil leaks in Nigeria.[106]\n",

The company has also invested in exploring for shale oil in Sichuan.[107] The other unconventional resource which Shell invested in in China was shale. The company was an early entrant in shale oil exploration in China but scaled down operations in 2014 due to difficulties with geology and population density.[108] It has a joint venture to explore for oil shale in Jilin through a joint venture with Jilin Guangzheng Mineral Development Company Limited.[109]\n",

FLNG technology is based on liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments that were pioneered in the mid-20th century and facilitates the exploitation of untapped natural gas reserves located in remote areas, often too small to extract any other way.[136][137]\n",
      "The floating vessel to be used for the Prelude field, known as Prelude FLNG, is promoted as the longest floating structure in the world and will take in the equivalent of 110,000 barrels of oil per day in natural gas—at a location 200 km (125 miles) off the coast of Western Australia—and cool it into liquefied natural gas for transport and sale in Asia. The Prelude is expected to start producing LNG in 2017[138]—analysts estimated the total cost of construction at more than US$12 billion.[136][137][139]\n",
      "Following the decision by the Royal Dutch Shell fuel corporation to close its Geelong, Australia refinery in April 2013, a third consecutive annual loss was recorded for Shell's Australian refining and fuel marketing assets. Revealed in June 2013, the writedown is worth A$203 million and was preceded by a A$638m writedown in 2012 and a A$407m writedown in 2011, after the closure of the Clyde refinery in Sydney, Australia.[140]\n",
      "In February 2014, Shell sold its Australian refinery and petrol stations for US$2.6 billion (A$2.9 billion) to Vitol, a Geneva-based company.[141] Vitol stated that the Geelong refinery will remain open, as the company plans to expand further into the Australian market. At the time of the sale, Royal Dutch Shell was expected to continue investment into the Australian market, with projects that involve Chevron Corp., Woodside Petroleum and Prelude.[55]\n",
      "Shell sold 9.5% of its 23.1% stake in Woodside Petroleum in June 2014 and advised that it had reached an agreement for Woodside to buy back 9.5% of its shares at a later stage. Shell became a major shareholder in Woodside after a 2001 takeover attempt was blocked by then federal Treasurer Peter Costello and the corporation has been open about its intention to sell its stake in Woodside as part of its target to shed assets. At a general body meeting, held on 1 August 2014, 72 percent of shareholders voted to approve the buy-back, short of the 75 percent vote that was required for approval. A statement from Shell read: \"Royal Dutch Shell acknowledges the outcome of Woodside Petroleum Limited's shareholders' negative vote on the selective buy-back proposal. Shell is reviewing its options in relation to its remaining 13.6 percent holding.\"[142]\n",

      "In the early 2000s Shell moved into alternative energy and there is now an embryonic \"Renewables\" business that has made investments in solar power, wind power, hydrogen, and forestry. The forestry business went the way of nuclear, coal, metals and electricity generation, and was disposed of in 2003. In 2006 Shell paid SolarWorld to take over its entire solar business[143] and in 2008, the company withdrew from the London Array which when built was the world's largest offshore wind farm.[144]\n",
      "Shell also is involved in large-scale hydrogen projects.

      "Arctic[edit]\n",
      "Following the purchase of an offshore lease in 2005, Shell initiated its US$4.5 billion Arctic drilling program in 2006, after the corporation purchased the \"Kulluk\" oil rig and leased the Noble Discoverer drillship.[165][166] At inception, the project was led by Pete Slaiby, a Shell executive who had previously worked in the North Sea.[167] However, after the purchase of a second offshore lease in 2008, Shell only commenced drilling work in 2012, due to the refurbishment of rigs, permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits.[168][169][170] The plans to drill in the Arctic led to protests from environmental groups, particularly Greenpeace; furthermore, analysts in the energy field, as well as related industries, also expressed skepticism due to perceptions that drilling in the region is \"too dangerous because of harsh conditions and remote locations\".[170][171]\n",
      "Further problems hampered the Arctic project after the commencement of drilling in 2012, as Shell dealt with a series of issues that involved air permits, Coast Guard certification of a marine vessel, and severe damage to essential oil-spill equipment. Additionally, difficult weather conditions resulted in the delay of drilling during mid-2012 and the already dire situation was exacerbated by the \"Kulluk\" incident at the end of the year. Royal Dutch Shell had invested nearly US$5 billion by this stage of the project.[167][170]\n",
      "As the Kulluk oil rig was being towed to the American state of Washington to be serviced in preparation for the 2013 drilling season, a winter storm on 27 December 2012 caused the towing crews, as well as the rescue service, to lose control of the situation. As of 1 January 2013, the Kulluk was grounded off the coast Sitkalidak Island, near the eastern end of Kodiak Island. Following the accident, a Fortune magazine contacted Larry McKinney, the executive director at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M, and he explained that \"A two-month delay in the Arctic is not a two-month delay ... A two-month delay could wipe out the entire drilling season.\"[167]\n",
      "It was unclear if Shell would recommence drilling in mid-2013, following the \"Kulluk\" incident, and, in February 2013, the corporation stated that it would \"pause\" its closely watched drilling project off the Alaskan coast in 2013, and will instead prepare for future exploration.[172] In January 2014, the corporation announced the extension of the suspension of its drilling program in the Arctic, with chief executive van Beurden explaining that the project is \"under review\" due to both market and internal issues.[173]\n",
      "A June 2014 interview with Pickard indicated that, following a forensic analysis of the problems encountered in 2012, Royal Dutch Shell will continue with the project and Pickard stated that she perceives the future of the corporation activity in the Arctic region as a long-term \"marathon\".[86] Pickard stated that the forensic \"look back\" revealed \"there was an on/off switch\" and further explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, don't spend the money unless you're sure you're going to have the legal environment to go forward. Don't spend the money unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't tell you that I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the on/off switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny.[86]\n",
      "Based upon the interview with Pickard, Shell is approaching the project as an investment that will reap energy resources with a lifespan of around 30 years.[86]\n",

      "Brent Spar platform[edit]\n",
      "In the 1990s, protesters criticised the company's environmental record, particularly the possible pollution caused by the proposed disposal of the Brent Spar platform into the North Sea. Despite support from the UK government, Shell reversed the decision under public pressure but maintained that sinking the platform would have been environmentally better.[174] Shell subsequently published an unequivocal commitment to sustainable development, supported by executive speeches reinforcing this commitment.[175] Shell was subsequently criticised by the European Commission and five European Union members after deciding to leave part of its decommissioned oil rigs standing in the North Sea. Shell argued that removing them would be too costly and risky. Germany said that the estimated 11,000 tonnes of raw oil and toxins remaining in the rigs would eventually seep into the sea, and called it a 'ticking timebomb'.[176]\n",
      "\n",
      "2004 overstatement of oil reserves[edit]\n",
      "In 2004 Shell overstated its oil reserves, resulting in loss of confidence in the group, a £17 million fine by the Financial Services Authority and the departure of the chairman Philip Watts. A lawsuit resulted in the payment of $450 million to non-American shareholders in 2007.[177][178][179]\n",
      "As a result of the scandal, the corporate structure was simplified. Two classes of ordinary shares, A (code RDSA) and B (code RDSB), identical but for the tax treatment of dividends, were issued for the company.[180]\n",
      "\n",
      "Corporate communications[edit]\n",
      " Shell Centre building in London, UK\n",
      "Shell's advertising regarding its renewable energy business has been described as a greenwash by some environmental lobbies,[181] leading to criticism from the British Advertising Standards Authority which ruled that Shell had misled the public in an advertisement when it claimed that a $10 billion oil sands project in Alberta, Canada was a \"sustainable energy source\".[182]\n",
      "\n",
      "Health and safety[edit]\n",
      "A number of incidents over the years led to criticism of Shell's health and safety record, including repeated warnings by the UK Health and Safety Executive about the poor state of the company's North Sea platforms.[183]\n",
      "\n",
      "Human rights[edit]\n",
      "In the beginning of 1996, several human rights groups brought cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. In particular, Shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders of the Ogoni tribe of southern Nigeria, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers.[184] The lawsuits were brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.[185] In 2009, Shell agreed to pay $15.5m in a legal settlement.[184] Shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it.[186]\n",
      "In 2009, Shell was the subject of an Amnesty International report into the deterioration of human rights as a consequence of Shell's activities in the Niger Delta. In particular, Amnesty criticised the continuation of gas flaring and Shell's slow response to oil spills.[187] In 1998, on its first public report on community and environmental issues in Nigeria, Shell promised \"to end the practice of gas flaring in ten years, while pledging to establish a youth training scheme in Ogoniland\".[188]\n",
      "In 2010, a leaked cable revealed that Shell claims to have inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government and know \"everything that was being done in those ministries\", according to Shell's top executive in Nigeria. The same executive also boasted that the Nigerian government had forgotten about the extent of Shell's infiltration.[102] Documents released in 2009 (but not used in the court case) reveal that Shell regularly made payments to the Nigerian military in order to prevent protests.[189]\n",
      "\n",
      "Arctic project[edit]\n",
      "According to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management report in 2015 the chances of a major spill in a deep-sea Arctic drilling is 75% before century's end.[190]\n",
      "\n",
      "Kodiak[edit]\n",
      "In 2010 Greenpeace activists painted \"No Arctic Drilling\" with spilled BP oil on the side of a ship in the Gulf of Mexico that was en route to explore for Arctic oil for Shell. At the protest, Phil Radford of Greenpeace called for \"President Obama [to] ban all offshore oil drilling and call for an end to the use of oil in our cars by 2030.\"[171]\n",
      "On 16 March 2012, 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica, multipurpose icebreakers chartered to support Shell's drilling rigs near Alaska.[191] Around the same time period, a reporter for Fortune magazine spoke with Edward Itta, an Inupiat leader and the former mayor of the North Slope Borough, who expressed that he was conflicted about Shell's plans in the Arctic, as he was concerned that an oil spill could destroy the Inupiat peoples hunting-and-fishing culture, but his borough also received major tax revenue from oil and gas production; additionally, further revenue from energy activity was considered crucial to the future of the living standard in Itta's community.[167]\n",
      "In July 2012, Greenpeace activists shut down 53 Shell petrol stations in Edinburgh and London in a protest against the company's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace's \"Save the Arctic\" campaign aims to prevent oil drilling and industrial fishing in the Arctic by declaring the uninhabited area around the North Pole a global sanctuary.[192]\n",
      "A review was announced after the Kulluk oil rig ran aground near Kodiak Island in December 2012.[193]\n",
      "In response, Shell filed lawsuits to seek injunctions from possible protests, and Benjamin Jealous of the NAACP and Radford argued that the legal action was \"trampling Americans' rights.\"[194] According to Greenpeace, Shell lodged a request with Google to take down video footage of a Greenpeace protest action that occurred at the Shell-sponsored Formula One (F1) Belgian Grand Prix on 25 August 2013, in which \"SaveTheArctic.org\" banners appear at the winners' podium ceremony. In the video, the banners rise up automatically—activists controlled their appearance with the use of four radio car antennas—revealing the website URL, alongside an image that consists of half of a polar bear's head and half of the Shell logo.[195]\n",
      "Royal Dutch Shell then announced a \"pause\" in the timeline of the project in early 2013[172] and, in September 2015, the corporation announced the extension of the suspension of its drilling program in the Arctic.[196]\n",
      "\n",
      "Polar Pioneer[edit]\n",
      "A June 2014 interview with the corporation's new executive vice president of the Arctic indicated that Royal Dutch Shell will continue with its activity in the region.[86][173]\n",
      "In Seattle protests began in May 2015 in response to the news that the Port of Seattle made an agreement with Shell to berth rigs at the Port's Terminal 5 during the off-season of oil exploration in Alaskan waters. The arrival of Shell's new Arctic drilling vessel, Polar Pioneer (IMO number: 8754140), a semi-submersible offshore drilling rig, was greeted by large numbers of environmental protesters paddling kayaks in Elliott Bay.[197][198]\n",
      "On 6 May 2015 it was reported that during a coast guard inspection of Polar Pioneer, a piece of anti-pollution gear failed, resulting in fines and delay of the operation.[199] Oil executives from Total and Eni interviewed by the New York Times, expressed scepticism about Shell's new ambitions for offshore drilling in the Arctic, and cited economic and environmental hurdles. ConocoPhillips and Equinor (formerly Statoil) suspended Arctic drilling earlier, after Shell's failed attempt in 2012.[200]\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil spills[edit]\n",
      "Shell was responsible for around 21,000 gallons of oil spilled near Tracy, California, in May 2016 due to a pipeline crack.[201]\n",
      "Shell was responsible for an 88,200-gallon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2016.[202]\n",
      "Two ruptures in a Shell Oil Co. pipeline in Altamont, California – one in September 2015 and another in May 2016 – had some questioning whether the Office of the State Fire Marshal, charged with overseeing the pipeline, was doing an adequate job.[203]\n",
      "On 29 January 2021, a Dutch court ordered Royal Dutch Shell Plc's Nigerian unit to compensate for oil spills in two villages over 13 years ago. Shell Nigeria is liable for damages from pipeline leaks in the villages of Oruma and Goi, the Hague Court of Appeals said in a ruling. Shell said that it should not be liable, as the spills were the result of sabotage.[204]\n",
      "Paradise Papers[edit]\n",
      "On 5 November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Argentine Energy Minister Juan José Aranguren was revealed to have managed the offshore companies 'Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited' and 'Sol Antilles y Guianas Limited', both subsidiaries of Shell. One is the main bidder for the purchase of diesel oil by the government through the state owned CAMMESA (Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico).[205]\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigeria corruption scandals[edit]\n",
      "Royal Dutch Shell and Italy's Eni will stand trial in Italy over allegations of corruption in the 2011 purchase of a big offshore oil field in Nigeria known as OPL 245. Shell and Eni reportedly paid $1.3 billion in bribes.[206] According to Barnaby Pace of campaign group Global Witness, \"This trial should be a wake-up call to the oil industry. Some of the most senior executives at two of the biggest companies in the world could face prison sentences for a deal that was struck under their watch.\"[206]\n",
      "In March 2018, Royal Dutch Shell has filed a criminal complaint against Peter Robinson, a former vice president for sub-Saharan Africa. Shell said the two cases were unrelated.[207]\n",
      "\n",
      "Oman 1954 War[edit]\n",
      "Further information: Jebel Akhdar War\n",
      "In 1937, Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), 23.75 percent owned by Royal Dutch Shell,[208] signed an oil concession agreement with the Sultan of Muscat. In 1952, IPC offered financial support to raise an armed force that would assist the Sultan in occupying the interior region of Oman, an area that geologists believed to be rich in oil. This led to the 1954 outbreak of Jebel Akhdar War in Oman that lasted for more than 5 years.[209]\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate case[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Milieudefensie et al v Royal Dutch Shell\n",
      "On 5 April 2019, Milieudefensie (Dutch for \"environmental defense\"), together with six NGOs and more than 17,000 citizens, sued Shell, accusing the company of harming the climate despite knowing about global warming since 1986.[210][211] In May 2021, the district court of The Hague ruled that Shell must reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 (compared to 2019 levels).[212]\n",

      "SOLUTIONS AND CONCENTRATEA BROAD SPECTRUM of formaldehyde solutions and UF concentrate (UFC) are used in a range of industries.\n",
      "Solutions of formaldehyde or formalin are used in the manufacture of synthetic resins due to their high reactivity with phenol, urea, melamine and other similar compounds. Georgia-Pacific Chemicals produces formaldehyde (HCHO) or formalin solutions at concentrations up to 52%, in both uninhibited and methanol-inhibited grades. Although these are the most popular formulations, we have the capability and expertise to customize unique formulations to meet your specific needs.\n",
      "GP® formaldehyde solutions are used as a raw material in a broad range of industries and applications including molded articles; high-pressure laminates; adhesives for plywood and particleboard as well as other wood panelboard products; coatings; varnishes and enamels; foundry core and shell binders; glass and mineral wool insulation; and fertilizers.\n",
      "We also manufacture INSOL-U-25® and STA-FORM 60® urea-formaldehyde concentrates (UFC), often called UFC85, which are used as precursors for fertilizers, urea-formaldehyde resins for wood adhesives and other industrial applications.\n",
      "We produce GP formaldehyde (HCHO) solutions and INSOL-U-25 and STA-FORM 60 UFC at strategically placed plants across the United States. Our capacity and diversity of manufacturing locations allow us to effectively support formaldehyde and UFC supply to the merchant market and our customers.\n",

      "INSOL-U-25® and STA-FORM 60® urea-formaldehyde concentrates (UFC) are clear, viscous liquids consisting of formaldehyde (HCHO), urea, and a small amount of water. Sometimes referred to generally as UFC85 or UFC-85, they provide some of the highest concentrations of formaldehyde commercially available in an easy-to-use form.\n",
      "Potential benefits of INSOL-U-25 and STA-FORM 60 UFC include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Longer storage stability than conventional aqueous formaldehyde solutions and less storage space required since urea and formaldehyde are combined.\n",
      "Can be stored at ambient temperatures.\n",
      "Convenient source of both urea and formaldehyde since active components are already in liquid form.\n",
      "Reduced cycle times since part of the combination reaction between urea and formaldehyde has already occurred and only one material is metered to the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "INSOL-U-25 and STA-FORM 60 UFC can be used in many applications where urea and formaldehyde are required ingredients. A major application for UFC85 products is as a precursor in the manufacture of liquid and dry nitrogen-based lawn and shrub fertilizers. Another major use for these products is in the preparation of urea-formaldehyde resins for wood product adhesives.\n",

      "\n",
      "Plastic is a useful, reliable material that has enabled huge advances in modern life, health and transport, but poor management, low perceived value and a lack of global infrastructure to support its recycling has led to environmental pollution through plastic leakage, landfill and incineration. With approximately just 9% of plastic produced to date having been recycled, this valuable resource is being lost. Mura Technology hold the key to turning the tide on waste plastic.\n",
      "Mura’s HydroPRS™ process utilises the Cat-HTR™ technology, which employs supercritical water, heat and pressure to convert waste plastics into valuable chemicals and oils by breaking down the long-chain hydrocarbons and donating hydrogen to produce shorter-chain, stable hydrocarbon products for sale into the petrochemical industry, for use in the production of new plastic and other materials, offering a recycling solution for all plastic types and in turn helping to create a circular economy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "                                 California-based petroleum corporation, Chevron, has announced a Series C investment in a start-up that manufactures and develops carbonate aggregates with the help of carbon capture.What are they doing?The start-up, Blue Planet, is capturing CO2 from flue gas by contacting it with ammoniated water. That carbonated solution is then used to form a carbonate mineral coating over a small rock particle. The result is a synthetic limestone rock (which is the main component of concrete). Here's a basic process flow diagram if you're into that sort of thing.Why is Chevron interested?Chevron, like most petroleum companies, is looking to reduce its environmental impact by working towards net-zero emissions. Blue Planet's solution (which is similar to one we've seen before) doesn't require \"CO2 purification and enrichment prior to use which can reduce cost and unit energy consumed during capture\". That makes it an attractive investment for a company facing intensified pressure from investors to reduce emissions and provide more sustainable energy.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 US-based EPC company, KBR, has been selected by process technology company, Mura Technology, as the exclusive licensing partner for Mura's proprietary chemical recycling method.First, some background:Mura has developed a technology that uses supercritical water to convert mixed plastic waste into a useful hydrocarbon product. The process depolymerizes plastic waste, splits the water molecules, and uses the available hydrogen to produce a mixture of hydrocarbons.  That mixture can then be distilled into naphtha, distillate gas oil, heavy gas oil, or heavy wax residue (which can be upgraded into plastics or other chemicals).What the agreement means:Mura's technology has yet to be seen at full-scale—but that's set to change early next year. The process technology company can't build plants on its own, so it's bringing in KBR to handle the \"studies, basic engineering, technical services, proprietary equipment and modules for the Cat-HTR technology.\". Together the companies can approach manufacturing firms with a turnkey solution.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Specialized polymers company, Avient, has announced that it will be expanding its existing production capabilities for color concentrates at its Binh Duong site in Vietnam by next month.Some context:Avient, formerly known as PolyOne, changed its name last summer after acquiring Clariant's masterbatch business. The business it acquired from Clariant was known for offering color and additive concentrates for plastics. It's safe to say that Avient's announcement is the realization of that acquisition.Going a little deeper:The purpose of coloring plastics is to enhance the market appeal of those plastics, and as consumption grows \"top brands focus on novel color solutions\". The expansion will \"improve speed-to-market and service level for local customers\" in Vietnam (where the plastic industry is seeing an annual growth rate of 16-18%). While those colors are good for business, they can be a pain for plastic recyclers—just something to think about.Read the press release here.\n",

The mass production of this controversial molecule got started in the 1950s by the condensation two equivalents of phenol (bisphenol) and acetone (A).Despite BPA's recognition as an artificial estrogen in the 1930s, the molecule's debatable health consequences have been outweighed by its ability to produce useful polycarbonates and vinyl ester resins. It is now known that trace amounts of BPA can be leached from the materials it is transformed into—when they are exposed to hard use (scratching) or high temperatures (your microwave and dishwasher).In any case, the world now produces nearly 10 million tons of the molecule each year. Most of that production is done by Covestro, SABIC, Chang Chun, Formosa, and LG Chem.\n",

      "                                 US-based petroleum company, Phillips 66, has been awarded a $3 million grant from the DOE to advance the development of high-performance reversible solid oxide fuel cells (RSOFC).Develop what?RSOFCs are special fuel cells—they can operate in power generation mode (by combining a fuel with oxygen) or in electrolysis mode (producing syngas from water and CO2). Electrochemical systems like RSOFCs hold the promise of overcoming the typical limitations of catalytic reactors (like relatively low selectivity and high energy consumption).Diving in:Phillips 66 has been granted 8 patents and has 22 patents pending in the area of solid oxide fuel cells. The company will take that money and work with Georgia Tech to \"demonstrate the commercial feasibility\" of this technology in hopes that someday it can serve as an efficient means of low-carbon energy production and low-cost carbon capture.Read the press release here.\n",

Plastic Energy is looking to have about 20 of these plants set in stone by 2023, so they are working with other companies like INEOS as well.More on this plant:Plastic Energy's patented process uses thermal anaerobic conversion to produce a pyrolysis oil (they call it TACOIL) from end-of-life plastics (mixed, contaminated, multi-layered, etc.). The plant they will be built on SABIC's Geleen site in the Netherlands so that it can directly supply the petrochemical company with a circular feedstock that can be transformed into plastics.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Dutch biochemicals company, Corbion, has announced that it will be increasing its lactic acid production at it's Blair, Nebraska site by 40%.Why the expansion?In recent years, the growing demand for lactic acid has been fueled by demand for polylactic acid and ethyl lactate. But that might not be the case here—instead, Corbion quoted \"growing demand for natural ingredients in multiple industries\", and emphasized how lactic acid and its derivatives can be used in \"foods and beverages for safe preservation\" and \"home and personal care products for effective but gentle disinfection and hygiene\".Anything else?The company is hoping to demonstrate that the plant expansion can occur without increasing its emissions. To do so, Corbion \"will employ technology designed to enable a significant boost in efficiency\" that we will surely hear more about at a later date.Read the press release here.\n",

Shortly after WWII, Hercules Powder figured out how the molecule can be used to produce phenol, making it an attractive molecule for petroleum companies to produce.As it was done back then, most of cumene produced today is done by the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene with propylene. That process spits out some 16 million tons per year of cumene. Nearly all of it, about 98%, is used to make phenol and acetone and the rest is used in high-octane aviation fuel or as a paint thinner.Some of the main companies pumping out all the cumene are BASF, Dow Chemical, Tata Chemicals, Ineos, and ExxonMobil.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 French industrial gases company, Air Liquide, has announced that the world's largest proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer has been installed at its site in Bécancour, Québec.How big are we talking?This new 20 MW electrolyzer will produce 9 tons of low-carbon hydrogen each year. Maybe that doesn't sound like much, but at 20 MW this electrolyzer has twice the capacity of the previous record holder. Hydropowered by Hydro-Québec and built with Cummins' technology (we last saw them in August) this electrolyzer avoids the CO2 emissions equivalent to 10,000 cars per year.Zooming out:PEM electrolyzers aren't the only option for green hydrogen production—they compete with alkaline (which has been here for a century) and solid oxide (still in development, and seen last time) electrolyzers. Technology differences aside, PEM offers a relatively lower OPEX in exchange for a higher CAPEX. But since PEM manufacturing is ramping up that CAPEX figure is expected to drop. Perhaps that's why Air Liquide now owns 19% of Cummins' hydrogen technology?Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Global petrochemical corporation, LyondellBasell, and Chinese petroleum company, Sinopec, have finalized the formation of a 50:50 joint venture (JV) to produce propylene oxide (PO) and styrene monomer (SM) in China.First, some context:The production of PO isn't so simple, as virtually all of its production methods come with a co-product. Maybe that sounds nice at first, but what if the demand for the co-product (SM) isn't growing as rapidly as the demand for PO? That's the case here, and that's why you are seeing this plant built in China (demand for styrene is still increasing) and not in the US (where it is to a lesser extent). If you want to dive into this PO problem check this out.The details:First announced roughly a year ago, this plant will pump out 275,000 tons of PO and 600,000 tons of SM each year. Most of that PO (let's call it 70%) ends up in polyurethanes, and basically all that styrene monomer is polymerized.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based Chevron and Phillips 66 joint venture, CP Chem, has announced that it's circular polyethylene (PE) has been certified by the ISCC and that it has selected a supplier for its pyrolysis oil.A little background:We last saw CP Chem in October when they announced the successful production of circular PE. The process cracks pyrolysis oil (from plastic waste) to produce the ethylene needed to make more PE. But cracking 100% pyrolysis oil isn't a likely first step, and that's why the ISCC certification is important (SABIC did this in October).What the announcement means:CP Chem isn't going to produce its own pyrolysis oil, they are going to buy it from Nexus Fuels. For each ton of pyrolysis oil that CP Chem feeds into the process, one ton of the output materials can be classified as circular. The company will sell that circular PE at a higher price (that's a fair assumption) under the \"Marlex® Anew™ Circular Polyethylene\" brand name.Read the press release here.\n",

It's companies like Ganfeng, Albemarle, SQM, and Livent that are making all of that lithium hydroxide (and doing it primarily in Australia and Chile).Nearly all of the lithium hydroxide produced is used to make the cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (such as lithium cobalt oxide and lithium ion phosphate), but the stuff can also be used in a few other ways.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemical corporation, Celanese, has announced the signing of a 15-year agreement to incorporate solar power at its site in Clear Lake, TX.More on the agreement:Calpine Energy Solutions will provide Celanese with up to 45 MW of solar capacity for its electricity needs at the site (it's not clear where those solar panels will be located). On an annualized basis, that's equivalent to 142,000 MWh (roughly 14,500 cars off the road). It isn't quite enough juice to satisfy all of Celanese's electricity needs, but it will replace about a third of the site's current electricity mix.An added bonus:While Celanese pumps out tons of methanol and acetic acid (plus their derivatives), this site is also home to a couple of units owned and operated by Arkema. Arkema, the spin-off from Total, will be included in Celanese's agreement with Calpine. That means that Arkema will also be incorporating solar power into its electricity supply mix, reducing the emissions associated with the production of its acrylic acid and acrylic esters.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Japan's largest chemical company, Shin-Etsu, has announced an expansion of its brand new chlor-alkali and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) facility in Louisiana.The details:It was just a couple of years ago that Shin-Etsu decided to build a greenfield facility in Plaquemine, LA. The site, which isn't done being built quite yet, was planned to produce roughly 300,000 tons each of VCM, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and caustic soda per year. The company has decided to spend an additional $1.25 billion to more than double the site's initial production capacity. The initial project should be completed by the middle of this year, and the expansion will be done sometime in 2023.Why do we need all that PVC?The company is doing this expansion because global demand for PVC has increased by an average of 1 million tons per year in the last decade. Most of that demand is coming from China (80%) because demand for PVC is closely tied to the construction industry (pipes, doors, window frames) and China is growing. By making that PVC with cheap US ethylene, Shin-Etsu will likely look to export what they produce.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 German chemical giant, BASF, has announced that it will be supplying a lead-acid battery recycler with the electrolyte required for its recycling process.What the recycler is doing:Typically, lead-acid batteries are recycled by smelting them at high-temperatures with many emissions. AquaMetals is a start-up that has figured out how to extract pure lead ingots from lead-acid batteries with a room temperature modular water-based process (here's a video). The new process requires an electrolyte, but AquaRefining won't be the one producing it.That's where BASF comes in:BASF has struck a deal with the start-up to provide the electrolyte that will be used \"for all new licensee facilities and will be the preferred supplier partner\" for all of AquaMetals' current licensees. If adopted widely, BASF could soon be producing quite a bit of this \"specially formulated AquaRefining electrolyte\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                You probably came across formaldehyde for the first time when dissecting a frog in middle school (does this give you any flashbacks?). Today, the world produces some 45 million tons of the molecule each year. Most of all that production is done in the same way, at least in principle, that August Wilhelm von Hofmann came up with in the late 19th century.Typically, formaldehyde is produce by the catalytic oxidation of methanol in the Formox process. Nearly 70% of all formaldehyde production is used to make urea-, phenol-, and melamine-formaldehyde resins (aka UF, PF, and MF). The remaining 30% is most notably used to produce BDO (which becomes Spandex) and MDI (which becomes rigid foams).Some of the world's largest formaldehyde producers are Georgia-Pacific, Hexion, Dynea, BASF, and Huntsman. While the production of formaldeyde is relatively simple, it's costly to transport, so most formaldehyde is consumed where it is produced.\n",

      "                                 US-based advanced plastics recycling start-up, Brightmark, has announced its intent to form a joint venture (JV) with SK Innovation to build a plastics pyrolysis plant in South Korea.A little background:Brightmark is set to achieve full commerical scale of its first advanced recycling plant early this year. The plant shreds waste plastic into pellets, depolymerizes it with pyrolysis, and sells the pyrolysis oil to petrochemical companies to convert it back into plastic. It was just last week that we saw CP Chem announce its first pyrolysis oil supplier—that's what this JV would do for SK Innovation.Diving in:Before the companies formally agree to the JV, they need to determine \"the most optimal methods to operate, scale and develop Brightmark’s technology within South Korea\". SK Innovation probably needs to confirm that it can utilize the pyrolysis oil provided by Brightmark's technology (they need to see if they can deal with the oil's impurities and try blending it into existing feedstocks).Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 San Antonio based refiner, Valero, has announced that its joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), has received approval to start construction of a new renewable fuels plant.Some context:Valero's JV, DGD, has been producing renewable fuels near Valero's 215,000 barrel per day refinery in Norco, Louisiana since 2013. The company announced its aspiration to build another renewable fuels plant under the JV a little over a year ago, and positive renewable diesel growth made the project more promising.What are the plans?DGD plans to convert cooking oil, rendered animal fats, and inedible corn oil into 470 million gallons of renewable diesel each year. Valero is hoping to make the most of its \"first mover advantage\" as the company expects \"low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 The chemical subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate, SK Group, has announced its plans to construct a lithium-ion battery plant in Hungary.Why you should care:Battery plants, like this one, are in the business of assembling the materials (cathode active material, anode material, electrolyte, and separator) into the battery cells found in EVs. Global chemical companies like BASF are the ones producing those materials (at these plants) from raw material producers like Albemarle. More battery plants (downstream) requires more chemical plants (upstream).The details:The new battery plant will be Europe's largest and the 3rd one built in Hungary (thanks to subsidies). Car companies such as Daimler, Audi, Volkswagen, BMW, Suzuki all have factories in Hungary—so it's not much of a stretch to assume those batteries are being produced for them.Read the press release here.\n",

While the molecule got its start as an antiseptic, today it is primarily used to make BPA (about 50%) and phenolic resins (about 30%). The rest becomes alkylphenols, a precursor to nylon, and adipic acid (here's a reference chart).Pretty much all of the phenol produced is made by the cumene process which conveniently produces the other BPA monomer—acetone. Quite a few different companies produce phenol, but Ineos is responsible for about 1/3 of the world's production. While most of the world's phenol is made in Asia, the largest US producers include , Shell, SABIC, and Olin.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemical company, Eastman, has announced its plan to build a molecular recycling facility at its site in Kingsport, Tennessee.A little context:This news shouldn't come as a huge surprise. We've talked about Eastman and its methanolysis technology before—the company has a few decades worth of experience in methanolysis and recently began sending customers some of its trial product. The CEO said that they \"have over 100 customer trials going on right now over a wide range of applications.\".So what is the plant going to do?This plant, unlike the pyrolysis plant announced last time, will convert a stream of waste PET plastic (instead of mixed plastic waste) back into its monomers by methanolysis (instead of thermal decomposition by pyrolysis). Those monomers can then be blended with traditional feedstocks and repolymerized into PET. If you need a primer on chemical recycling this is a pretty solid guide.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 A consortium of private equity companies has announced the acquisition of DuPont's Clean Technologies business for $510 million cash.What are they buying?Perhaps when you read \"clean technologies\" you imagined something \"greener\" than the desulfurization and alkylation technologies this business is known for. But those processes are clean technologies—all of them work to reduce pollution (removing sulfur, scrubbing flue gas, producing higher-octane fuels). The business makes its money by licensing those process technologies to operating companies that don't have their own. What are they saying?While still subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the consortium expects the transaction to close by 2Q 2021. The firms involved plan to \"build on this strong foundation and further expand the business with the support of management and our strategic partners.\". The international nature of the firms involved (there is one from the US, China, and Saudi Arabia) will \"act as a strong complement to the global operations of this leading platform\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Illinois-based specialty chemicals company, Stepan, has announced the acquisition of Invista's aromatic polyester polyol business and its associated assets.What is Invista selling?Invista is most well known today for producing adiponitrile, hexamethylene diamine, adipic acid, and their derivatives. The (non-core) business it is selling produces aromatic polyester polyols that are most often  (65%) converted into rigid polyurethane foams.Zooming out:We last saw Stepan when it acquired part of Clariant's surfactant business. This acquisition, like the last one, is best defined as a bolt-on acquisition. The purchase will add 2 polyol production sites to Stepan's existing 5, and \"supports the growth of [its] global rigid polyol business\". The company believes that Invista's \"available spare capacity\" and \"debottlenecking opportunities\" will make growth in the sector capital efficient.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based integrated petroleum company, ExxonMobil, has announced the formation of a new business unit called ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions.What that means:Companies typically create new business units as a strategic move—giving the business the standalone management it deserves. Exxon has pledged to invest \"$3 billion on lower emission energy solutions\" by 2025 through the new business unit. Critics have been quick to put that number in perspective (it's roughly 4% of planned capital expenditures), but in any case Exxon is giving low-carbon solutions more attention than ever before.So what's next?There are more than a few CCS opportunities being explored, including an plan to store CO2 from the US Gulf Coast \"in onshore and offshore geologic formations\". Even though it's not clear how Exxon will allocate that $3 billion, it is clear that the company is open to government involvement. The company mentioned that \"CCS opportunities can become more commercially attractive through government policy\" (like the US's 45Q or the countless policies in Europe).Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemical company, Eastman, has announced the successful startup of a new dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) unit at its site in Nanjing, China.What are they making?Eastman is the world's largest producer of DMAE—an intermediate chemical that (through another intermediate) is copolymerized with acrylamide to make polyacrylamides. Polyacrylamides are typically used to flocculate solids in a liquid, so the polymer often finds itself in water treatment processes removing solid particles.Zooming out:While the chemical this new unit produces is rather obscure, it plays a critical role in the purification of water. That's why Eastman takes the time to emphasize how the \"need for clean water truly affects people's daily lives\". It may not seem like much of an announcement, but more DMAE means more clean water.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Illinois-based specialty chemicals company, Stepan, has announced the acquisition of a fermentation plant located in Lake Providence, Louisiana.Some context:If it feels like you just read about Stepan making an acquisition, it's because you did. But that last acquisition wasn't really in the company's wheelhouse (they are known for producing surfactants). This purchase is unique because surfactants are typically produced from synthetic feedstocks derived from oil and gas.Diving in:The company is looking to \"commercialize next generation surfactants\" citing biosurfactants produced by fermentation as its next big thing. While biosurfactants do have some advantageous properties, it's really only worth the investment because \"customers across markets seek new sustainability targets for their products.\".Read the press release here.\n",

While that may sound nice, this molecule isn't something to mess with—its use in World War I as a chemical weapon claimed nearly 100,000 lives.The molecule was named by a Cornish chemist in 1812 when he exposed carbon monoxide and chlorine to sunlight (phos = light and gene = born). Today, the world produces roughly 9 million tons each year primarily by passing carbon monoxide and chlorine gas through a bed of activated carbon.Instead of thinking of its use as a chemical weapon or grassy smell, try to remember phosgene for its critical role in the production of polyurethanes and polycarbonates. About 80% of all phosgene is used to make the isocyanates that become all of these things. Most of the rest of it is reacted with BPA that is used for this stuff.Some of the main companies producing all of this phosgene are Covestro, BASF, Yantai Wanhua, and Huntsman.\n",

Polyimides are used for things like flexible cables (like the cable connecting your laptop's logic board to the display) and those laminates serve as one of the many layers of printed circuit boards.Bigger picture:Companies like DuPont aren't the first to come to mind when we hear about new electronics and technologies—but chemical companies play a critical role in this arena. The materials DuPont is producing are necessary for \"innovations in areas such as 5G, automotive, flexible displays, and artificial intelligence\". The plant expansion is happening because those technologies are expected to see quite a bit of growth in the coming decade.Read the press release here.\n",

Its site in Pasadena is getting 10 MW of wind power from that same wind farm in west Texas.Zooming out:The renewable power supplied to these sites is done through power purchase agreements (PPA) that lock BASF into paying for the power produced at large wind and solar farms. These agreements ensure that the large farms are worth building because at least large chemical companies are willing to pay for whatever renewable energy is produced.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Dutch energy giant, Shell, has announced its new net-zero emissions strategy.Summing it up:Reduce oil production by 1-2% each year going forwardReduce production of traditional fuels (gasoline, diesel, etc.) by 55% by 2030Increase cash generation from chemicals by $1-2 billion a year by 2030Reduce emissions intensity 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035, and 100% by 2050How they will do it:The oil production reduction will be achieved through \"divestments and natural decline\", and the reduction in traditional fuels production will occur as Shell shifts its production to chemicals. The company reminded us that it will reduce its refinery footprint to just 6 highly integrated sites (it's down to 13 after shutting one down last year). You can expect more investment in chemical production from recycled waste too because Shell is aiming \"to annually process 1 million tonnes a year of plastic waste\" by 2025.Read the press release here and a detailed analysis here.\n",

      "                                 Delaware-based chemical company, DuPont, has announced that it will be collaborating with Vulcan Energy to produce lithium hydroxide with a net-zero carbon footprint.Here's that context:The demand for EVs (and therefore batteries and their raw materials) is rising dramatically. That means that older chemical companies (like Albemarle and SQM) and start-ups (like Li-Cycle and Vulcan) are scrambling to produce more lithium hydroxide. But the production of lithium hydroxide has associated emissions—which is where Vulcan brings something unique to the table. The company aims to use geothermal energy to power its lithium extraction process.What are they doing together?DuPont has a technology portfolio of products like \"lithium selective sorbent, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange resins, ultrafiltration, and close circuit reverse osmosis\". Vulcan believes that DuPont's technologies are \"likely to be well-suited to sustainably extract the lithium from the brine\" and is pleased that the 200-year-old company can already produce those products at scale.Read the press release here or TechCrunch's take here.\n",

      "                                 South Carolina based specialty chemical company, Ingevity, has announced plans to add caprolactone polyol production to its site in DeRidder, Louisiana.What are they making?Ingevity has developed a process that converts caprolactone (not to be confused with the nylon monomer) into a polyol. That polyol can then be used to produce the polyurethanes that become things like your mattress, your shoe soles, or rollerblade wheels. Caprolactone polyols are supposedly a good balance between the properties of ester and ether polyols.What are Ingevity's plans?The company is looking to increase its production capacity by 40% to \"better meet demand and more effectively serve its customers.\". The construction (starting this summer) will not only let Ingevity produce more of its special polyol, but also allow them to store more of it and \"enable bulk shipments to US customers\".Read the press release here.\n",

Now that \"ground preparations and foundation work [are] already underway\", the project is expected to be complete \"before the end of this year.\". Once operational CRI will be responsible for recycling over 160,000 tons of CO2 per year (equivalent to the emissions of 60,000 cars).Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                Owing its name to the smell of burnt fat (glycerol in the fat thermally degrades into acrolein—which smells acrid), acrylic acid is commonly produced by oxidizing propylene to acrolein and then oxidizing that acrolein.Today, the world produces over 6 million tons of acrylic acid each year. The largest portion of it (about half) is used to make acrylates and about 30% is used to make superabsorbent polymer (mainly for use in diapers). Those acrylates and other monomers are typically combined to make polyacrylic acid and other polymers that become plastics, coatings, adhesives, and elastomers.The acrylic acid market is fairly consolidated with BASF, Dow Chemical, Arkema, and Formosa making up about half of global production.\n",

      "                                 US-based integrated petroleum company, ExxonMobil has completed the first phase of a plant trial to convert plastic waste into feedstock for new polymers.What did they do?While Exxon decided not to disclose any details regarding the test, the company is probably cracking pyrolysis oil (made from plastic waste) with its existing equipment. If that's what they are up to then they can join the list of other petrochemical companies trying this solution—recently we've seen CP Chem, Shell, and Neste all doing the same thing.Taking a step back:If you've been reading this newsletter for a while you might remember when Exxon announced a new joint venture (JV) back in December. That JV, called Cyclyx, is aiming to become a world leader in the aggregation and pre-processing of plastic waste. That JV is where Exxon will find its supply of usable waste-based feedstock in the future and it's something unique Exxon has going for itself.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 German chemicals company, Covestro, has announced the successful production of a rigid polyurethane foam made with a novel CO2-based polyol.A little background:Polyurethanes (the polymers that become your mattress, seat cushions, and so much more) are produced by reacting polyols with isocyanates. There are countless different combinations possible that yield unique properties and applications. But these useful materials are traditionally produced from entirely petroleum-based chemicals. The company has been looking for sustainable alternatives and found its first in the polycarbonate polyols made from CO2 at its site in Germany.So what happened?Covestro has been developing another CO2-based polyol with a few other companies, and this announcement signals an early success. The company has successfully produced a rigid polyurethane foam made from a novel ethylene oxide and CO2-based polyol. Going forward Covestro wants to \"manufacture additional prototypes and to enhance the properties\" of its new foam for eventual use as in insulation board in the construction industry (which would love a new way to reduce its emissions).Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 French chemical company, Arkema, has announced that it will be expanding its site in Changshu, China to produce 35% more fluoropolymer.What are they making?The most well-known fluoropolymer is Teflon, but Arkema's fluoropolymer of choice is none other than polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). This polymer, specifically Arkema's Kynar brand, has found itself most useful as an electrode binder or separator coating in lithium-ion batteries. The company actually has a helpful video you can check out here.So why the expansion?Arkema just finished expanding this plant by 50% at the end of last year. As you've probably figured out by now, the company is continuing to expand its PVDF production because of \"further strong demand in the lithium-ion battery business\". More electric vehicles, cell phones, and other devices mean more batteries and therefore more polymers that bind them together.Read the press release here.\n",

Cyclohexane, unlike its resonant cousin benzene, was first produced by synthesis (as it wasn't found naturally occuring in coal). Today, the world produces cyclohexane by hydrogenating benzene in the presence of the same catalyst Murray Raney used to hydrogenate vegetable oils in the 1920s.About 10% of the world's benzene is used to make cyclohexane, so annual production of cyclohexane is roughly 6 million tons each year. Virtually all of that cyclohexane is used to make cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, which, in turn, are mainly used to make caprolactam (45%) and adipic acid (22%). Both adipic acid and caprolactam are primarily used to make nylon.The cyclohexane market is fairly fragmented—the main producers don't produce much more than the minor producers. In any case, the companies producing cyclohexane are typically those who produce benzene or those nylon precursors. Think of BASF, CP Chem, and ExxonMobil.\n",

The enormous units produce nearly all of the olefins and aromatics that our world demands. But the energy-intensive process is heated primarily by the combustion of natural gas—a process responsible for about half of petrochemical emissions. With increasing pressure to reduce emissions, companies have been searching for ways to power these crackers with renewables by electrifying the furnaces (like the heating element in your oven).Why this time is different:This isn't the first partnership with the goal of developing a greener cracking technology (these companies have partnered before and so have Dow and Shell). But this time the companies are evaluating a \"multi-megawatt demonstration plant at BASF’s Ludwigshafen site\" with the hope of starting-up sometime in 2023 (so long as they get the funding they need).Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Chemical recycling start-up, Plastic Energy, and US-based petroleum company, ExxonMobil, have announced plans to build a chemical recycling plant next to ExxonMobil's petrochemical complex in France.Some context:In the past, Exxon hasn't been the most vocal about its chemical recycling efforts (compared to some of its peers). But recently we've seen the company get in on a joint venture with Agilyx and successfully completed a trial using a pyrolysis oil made from plastic waste. We've seen Plastic Energy announce nearly identical partnerships with SABIC and Total in the past as well.So, what's next?The companies are planning to build a plant capable of consuming about 30,000 tons per year of plastic waste. While that figure is small relative to the 7 billion tons not recycled each year, you have to start somewhere. The companies aim to make a final investment decision this year (with a little financial help from the French government) and start-up the site in 2023.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 German specialty chemical company, Evonik, has completed its sodium methylate expansion at its site in Mobile, Alabama.Why the expansion?While sodium methylate has plenty of different uses, it's the molecule's ability to catalyze the transesterification of vegetable oils and animal fats that led Evonik to expand its production (translation: we use it to make biodiesel). Recently, we've seen Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum announce plans to increase their biodiesel capacity. As we make more biodiesel we'll need more sodium methylate—unless you're making renewable diesel like Valero.The details:Evonik's plant can now produce nearly 100,000 tons of sodium methylate each year by reacting methanol with sodium. The company hopes \"to strengthen its position serving the performance chemicals and life science markets\" in addition to that demand for biodiesel.Read the press release here.\n",

Over the course of the next few decades the demand for polypropylene (PP) made its monomer the second most popular olefin globally.Today, the world produces over 110 million tons of the stuff each year. About 75% of it is made with steam crackers and FCC, and over two-thirds of it is used to make PP. The rest of that propylene is useful as well—7% of it becomes PO, 7% oxo alcohols, 6% acrylonitrile, 4% acrylic acid, and 4% cumene (more details can be found here).The main companies producing all this propylene include SABIC, Dow Chemical, , and basically any other company with a steam cracker or two.\n",

      "                                 American oil & gas giant, Chevron, and petroleum process technology company, Honeywell UOP, have announced the successful start-up of the world's first ionic liquids alkylation unit.Here's some context:Over half of the world's refineries utilize alkylation units to convert isobutane and light alkenes into a mixture of mostly isoheptane and isooctane. Refiners install this expensive unit to produce more high-octane gasoline instead of selling more LPG only when it makes economic sense.So, what's special about this new technology?Until now, all alkylation units used either sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid to catalyze the reaction. This new technology catalyzes the reaction with an ionic liquid (think of it like liquid table salt—except only at 100°C). That has quite a few benefits including, but not limited to, \"simpler handling procedures\" thanks to the low vapor pressure of ionic liquids relative to those strong acids.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Canadian-based battery recycling start-up, Li-Cycle, has announced that it will be building a new lithium-ion battery recycling facility near Pheonix, AZ.What that facility is doing:Li-Cycle is tackling battery recycling by building decentralized \"spokes\" that will feed centralized \"hubs\". This new plant is a spoke—which means that it mechanically shreds used lithium-ion batteries to produce a mixture of lithium, manganese, cobalt, and nickel. That mixture is then sent to a hub to refine all of the materials for reuse (a hub in New York is coming soon).Bigger picture:This will be the companies third spoke, doubling its total recycling capacity in North America to a total of 22,000 tons per year. Eventually, Li-Cycle will need to build a hub out in the western US to convert that shredded mixture into the lithium carbonate, cobalt sulfate, and nickel sulfate needed to make more batteries. Perhaps that will be announced shortly after the company goes public later this year.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based refiner, Phillips 66, has awarded EPC firm, Worley, with a front-end engineering design (FEED) services contract to convert one of its refineries into a renewable fuels complex.Bringing you up to speed:It was last August when Phillips 66 told the world that it's planning on renewing its refinery near San Francisco, CA. Since then, we've seen the company increase its renewable production in the U.K. and other refiners (like Valero) make similar announcements.The details:Phillips 66 is looking to produce up to 650 million gallons per year of renewable fuels at this site from \"used cooking oils, fats, greases, and vegetable oils\". To make that happen, Worley will be performing all the detailed engineering that comes with new pre-treatment units, repurposed hydrocracking units, and everything in between. The plant is expected to be up and running here in a few years.Read the press release here.\n",

We do know that it's \"still widely used\" by the military today and that we made enormous quantities of it during the world wars.In any case, when we make it, we make it by nitrating toluene three times. Generally speaking, it's large refiners who produce toluene, so perhaps they sell (relatively) small quantities of that feedstock to the government?\n",

      "                                 Oil & gas start-up, Nacero, has announced the selection of Haldor Topsoe's natural-gas-to-gasoline technology for its upcoming $4 billion site out in West Texas.What are they doing out there?Nacero is planning on producing 100,000 barrels-per-day of gasoline by using natural gas, bio-methane, and mitigated flared gas from the Permian basin. The upcoming plant will be powered by on-site solar panels, capture all the CO2 it produces (assuming that it will be used to enhance oil recovery), and co-produce hydrogen. If all goes well the plant will be up and running by 2025.Zooming out:It's well-known that gasoline is produced by refining crude oil, but converting natural gas into gasoline isn't a new concept either. ExxonMobil did this for about 5 years starting in 1985, and today Haldor Topsoe's technology is currently in use in Turkmenistan. This time is different though—Nacero's proposed plant will have roughly 10x the capacity of any previously seen realization of the technology.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 The joint venture between French oil & gas giant, Total, and biochemicals company, Corbion, has awarded Italian EPC firm, NextChem, with a front-end engineering design (FEED) services contract to design a 100,000 ton per year polylactic acid (PLA) plant.Bringing you up to speed:Last fall, Total announced that its refinery in Grandpuits, France will be shut down and converted into \"a zero-crude platform for biofuels and bioplastics\". That announcement included news that the company would be teaming up with Corbion to produce PLA at the site. Now, those two companies have decided to have NextChem design the plant.Why PLA?By polymerizing lactic acid (which is typically made by fermentation) we're able to produce a plastic comparable to some common petroleum-based plastics. While PLA is semi-compostable it's typically not recycled industrially like most other plastics (that doesn't mean it's not recyclable). We'll probably see more biobased plastics like PLA enter the market as we work to solve our plastic recycling problem.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Chinese oil & gas giant, Sinopec, has announced that it has successfully started up two new alkylation units provided by DuPont's Clean Technologies business.A quick comparison:About a week ago, we saw Chevron and Honeywell UOP start up an alkylation unit based on an ionic liquid catalyst. That ionic liquid technology is brand new—what Sinopec just implemented is a relatively standard sulfuric acid-catalyzed process. In fact, DuPont has installed over 100 of these units in the past.Zooming out:The last time we talked about DuPont's Clean Technologies business was when the company announced that it was being acquired for $510 million. While it's not clear whether the ionic liquid technology will dominate future refinery upgrades, we do know that Sinopec is interested in developing its own ionic liquid technology. Until then, and while DuPont's business is being acquired, operating companies (like Sinopec) will continue to license alkylation technologies from 3rd parties.Read the press release here.\n",

Farben started us off in 1931.Today, the world produces about 17 million tons of this stuff each year. Most of it is made by the free radical polymerization of styrene (which is made from either ethylbenzene or coproduced with propylene oxide). Of course, we use polystyrene to make polymeric foams (looking at you, Styrofoam), molded plastics (like CD cases), and various copolymers (including the rubber in tires).The big guys making of all this polystyrene are Ineos, Trinseo, and Total just to name of few of the many.\n",

      "                                 Japanese chemical company, Mitsui Chemicals, has announced that it is working with IBM to start working on a blockchain-based resource circulation platform.A little background:When you hear \"blockchain\" the first thing you probably think of is bitcoin—or the various other cryptocurrencies (if you're into that sort of thing). But the blockchain technology also has the potential to revolutionize industry supply chains by making them more transparent. Eventually you'll see the blockchain built into existing ERP systems that chemical companies already use to track the manufacturing and sales of their products.What it means for chemicals:Basically, Mitsui Chemicals and IBM have agreed to develop a platform, using blockchain, to ensure that individual molecules can be traced through their life cycle. That has huge implications for the recycling of plastics and the circular economy at large. If you're still interested, try giving this more generic article from the Harvard Business Review a read.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Spanish petroleum company, Repsol, has announced that will be joining this waste management company and Canadian process technology company, Enerkem, to build a waste-to-methanol plant in Spain.The plans:The three companies are planning to convert 440,000 tons of non-recyclable solid waste into 242,000 tons of methanol each year. If the companies make their final investment decision by early next year (as expected), the plant would be operational sometime in 2025.How they would do it:Enerkem's proprietary gasification technology converts non-recyclable waste into syngas. Syngas, the well-known mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, will then be converted into methanol for use in the chemical industry. This approach to utilizing waste should remind you of LanzaTech's biotechnology that can produce ethanol (and potentially many other chemicals) from syngas.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Global specialty chemicals company, Nouryon, has announced that it has started up its recently expanded joint venture monochloroacetic acid (MCA) plant in Gujarat, India.Bringing you up to speed:Last October, we saw Nouryon get the environmental clearance required to start producing more MCA at this plant. The company expected the plant to reach its full production capacity by the first half of this year—so this announcement is basically just saying \"we did it\".Why they did it:While MCA is primarily used to make cellulose gum and modified starch (which end up in ice creams, mac n' cheese, and adhesives), this plant was probably built to make this herbicide that Nouryon's JV partner produces. Herbicides, like that one, have always played a critical role in ensuring that there is food for rapidly expanding populations (like India's).Read the press release here.\n",

The largest portion of it (about half) is used to make acrylates and about 30% is used to make superabsorbent polymer (mainly for use in diapers). Those acrylates and other monomers are typically combined to make polyacrylic acid and other polymers that become plastics, coatings, adhesives, and elastomers.The acrylic acid market is fairly consolidated with BASF, Dow Chemical, Arkema, and Formosa making up about half of global production.\n",

      "                                 Consumer goods company, Unilever, has announced the launch of a laundry capsule made with industrial carbon emissions thanks to carbon recycling start-up, LanzaTech and India Glycols.Spelling it out for you:LanzaTech converted emissions from a steel mill in China into ethanol by fermenting syngas. That ethanol was then converted into ethylene oxide (EO) by India Glycols. That EO was then added to some fatty alcohols by ethoxylation to produce a surfactant. That emission-based surfactant is the part of detergent creates foam in your washing mashine (allowing dirt to be washed away).Zooming out:EO is typcially produced oxidizing ethylene (from the oil & gas industry). But if consumer goods companies want to offer sustainable laundry solutions, they are going to need a lot of these special surfactants. Perhaps that's why a couple of months ago we saw India Glycols for a JV with Clariant to expand its ethanol-based EO production.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based styrenics producer, Trinseo, has completed the acquisition of Arkema's MMA and PMMA businesses for $1.24 billion.A little background:Trinseo announced that it would be acquiring this business back in December. The acquisition is important to Trinseo as the company attempts to transform its portfolio away from cyclical low-margin businesses (like its synthetic rubber business we talked about on Monday). On the other hand, Arkema is looking to become a specialty materials company that focuses on adhesives, coatings, and other advanced materials (of which PMMA does not belong).Wait, what's MMA and PMMA?Pretty much everyone is familiar with PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate)—the transparent rigid plastic commonly referred to by the brand name \"plexiglass\". But if you want to make PMMA you need to make MMA (methyl methacrylate) first. Trinseo is purchasing Arkema's seven integrated production sites that do just that.Read the press release here.\n",

Since then, we've seen the company increase its renewable production in the U.K. and other refiners (like Valero) make similar announcements. Today's announcment tells us that Phillips 66 is now producing 16% of what it plans to by 2024.Bigger picture:There is a lot of talk about biofuels in this newsletter because for two main reasons:Renewable diesel capacity in the US is expected by a factor of 6 through 2024Press releases about sustainability are no-brainers for any companyBut putting those changes in perspective is important—so check out this graphic that visualizes how much renewable fuel capacity will grow relative to petroleum.Read the press release here.\n",

Just one decade ago, Shell owned and operated 54 refineries—and by last October we saw the company down to just 14. Further, Shell announced plans to reduce its refinery footprint to just 6 highly-integrated sites.Why is HollyFrontier buying?Just because Shell doesn't want to focus on the conventional oil & gas business doesn't mean we don't still need oil & gas. The refinery will be HollyFrontier's first on the US West Coast and is expected to \"complement [their] existing refining business\". That's because the facility has access to advantaged Canadian crude and can sell into premium markets.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 German chemical giant, BASF, and metals technology company, Umicore, have entered into a patent cross-license agreement for the wide range of cathode materials and their precursors.What that means:The two companies have agreed to combine their technologies that affect the \"chemical composition, powder morphology, and chemical stability.\" of various cathode materials such as NCM and NCA for lithium-ion batteries. The agreement covers over 100 patent families filed around the globe that are \"largely complementary\".Piecing it together:Last November, BASF broke ground on a brand new cathode materials plant in Schwarzheide, Germany. The plant, scheduled to start-up in 2022, will eventually produce enough cathodes for 400,000 electric vehicles each year. This cross-licensing agreement will rapidly increase BASF's product development speed and ensure that no time is wasted trying to develop independent technologies.Read the press release here.\n",

This 70 MW electrolysis system will be integrated into Liquid Wind's facilities to split water into green hydrogen and oxygen using wind power.Bigger picture:This is the last piece of Liquid Wind's technology puzzle—the company already selected Carbon Clean's technology to source CO2 and Haldor Topsoe's technology to hydrogenate that CO2 into methanol. Liquid Wind's first plant aims to capture 70,000 tons of CO2 and produce 45,000 tons of methanol each year (primarily for use as a fuel in the shipping industry).Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Czech petroleum company, Orlen Unipetrol, has announced the start-up of a chemical recycling pilot plant in Litvínov.Some context:The chemical recycling of plastic waste comes up frequently in this newsletter because most of the large chemical companies are working on the plastic waste issue (and they want that to be known). Most often we see smaller companies convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil and larger companies use that oil as a steam cracker feedstock.Why this is special:Orlen Unipetrol is now the second refining and petrochemical company to launch a chemical recycling pilot plant. Like LyondellBasell, the company isn't just open to the idea of using pyrolysis oil, they want to have a hand making it upstream. If the company's technology proves to be viable you can expect the Czech Republic's 37% plastic recycling rate to increase quickly.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 German chemical giant, BASF, has announced plans to expand its platinum-group metals (PGM) refining capacity to recycle spent catalysts.A little background:Before the emissions can make it out of your car's tailpipe they undoubtedly pass through a catalytic converter. That catalyst becomes spent after about 100,000 miles leaving behind valuable, and currently unused, PGMs like platinum, palladium, and rhodium. BASF's facility uses smelting and refining processes to recover those PGMs to make more catalysts.A quick comparison:It's fairly well-known that the recycling of metals, such as lead, magnesium, iron, and aluminum have much higher recycling rates than plastics. There's no shortage of reasons as to why that's the case, but fundamentally it's because recycling metals is less energy intensive and cheaper than mining.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Global specialty chemicals company, Nouryon, has announced the start of the engineering phase for its upcoming world-scale polymerization plant for expandable microspheres in Green Bay, Wisconsin.What are they making?Developed by Dow Chemical in the 1960s, these microscopic spheres are made of a thermoplastic shell that encapsulate a low boiling point liquid hydrocarbon. The little spheres (which Nouryon calls \"the world's favorite secret ingredient\") are used as lightweight fillers and blowing agents because the material can expand up to 60x in volume. That makes them useful in wine corks, roof cooling coatings, and food packaging.The details:Nouryon first announced its plans to build this plant over two years ago—today the company is letting us know that it's still working on the project. While the plant was initially scheduled for completion late last year, it now looks like construction will begin late this year.Read the press release here.\n",

But of the 4 million tons the world produces each year, very little of it actually ends up in the food industry.Virtually all of the adipic acid produced is made by oxidizing a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol called KA oil with nitric acid. Roughly 90% of all that adipic acid is used to make nylon 6,6. The rest of it is esterified and added to PVC or finds its way into polyurethanes as a polyester polyol.The main companies producing the world's most important dicarboxylic acid are often the same ones who make nylon—that's BASF, Ascend, Lanxess, and Asahi Kasei.\n",

The majority of that carbon black (70%) is used to pigment and reinforce tires, and most of the remainder is used in food packaging and inks. The hydrogen produced can then be used as energy storage or as a feedstock for chemicals (like ammonia).Why the investment?SK Group's investment follows a $1.5 billion investment in Plug Power (a leading hydrogen player in the US). The last time we saw a major investment in Monolith was when Mitsubishi threw money at the company with the hope that hydrogen will eventually power its new turbines. Similarly, SK Group's investment reflects the companies interest in hydrogen usage further downstream.Read the press release here.\n",

That investment explains why NatureWorks is building this plant in Thailand (PTT is a Thai state-owned company).What makes this plant special:The plant, which is scheduled for completion in 2024, will be \"the world’s first polylactide facility designed to be fully integrated\". That means that the site will convert dextrose (from corn or another crop) into lactic acid, turn that into lactide, and then polymerize it into a bio-based plastic that resembles classic thermoplastics like PE and PP.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Russian petrochemical company, Sibur, has announced a joint project with industrial gases company, Linde, to purify and market the CO2 by-product of ethylene oxide (EO) synthesis.Where that CO2 is coming from:CO2 emissions from the chemical industry come from two sources—when hydrocarbons are burned to produce heat or when CO2 is produced by a reaction in the process. For example, we produce olefins (valuable, reactive molecules) by cracking (adding heat from burned hydrocarbons) to stable molecules like ethane. Once we have a reactive molecule, like ethylene, heat is sparingly required and the CO2 emissions are a product of the oxidation reaction that makes EO.So what's the plan?Linde plans to build a pipeline from Sibur's ethylene oxide operations and \"a gas treatment unit to process it into a commercial-grade product usable in the food industry\". That means that the CO2 produced by this petrochemical process will be used for freezing food, carbonating beverages, and for modified atmosphere packaging. The project should be complete by the end of next year and is in line with Sibur's goal of reducing \"GHG emission intensity by 35% by 2028\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                Lithium hydroxide got its big debut during the Cold War as an intermediate in the production of tritium to produce nuclear fusion weapons. The US became the primary producer of lithium hydroxide between 1950s-1980s, but things have changed since then.Today, most lithium hydroxide is produced from the lithium carbonate that lithium brines give us. It's companies like Ganfeng, Albemarle, SQM, and Livent that are making all of that lithium hydroxide (and doing it primarily in Australia and Chile).Nearly all of the lithium hydroxide produced is used to make the cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (such as lithium cobalt oxide and lithium ion phosphate), but the stuff can also be used in a few other ways.\n",

Genomatica has developed a fermentation process using a genetically engineered microorganism that produces BDO instead of ethanol when fed sugars.The details:The planned facility is expected to cost $300 million, will produce over 70,000 tons of BDO per year, and is scheduled for completion in 2024. It will be the second commercial-scale plant that utilizes Genomatica's technology—Novamont currently owns and operates a facility that produces 30,000 tons of BDO per year.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemical recycling start-up, Brightmark, has announced plans to build a $680 million plant in Macon, Georgia capable of diverting 400,000 tons of end-of-life mixed plastic waste per year.Some context:Last October we talked a little bit about Brighmark's site selection process—the company is looking to build multiple $500M+ chemical recycling plants across the US. Brightmark is still in the process of selecting more sites and was initially planning to have two sites \"shovel-ready\" by 2021. Until these sites are built Brightmark will continue to operate its only plant up in Ashley, Indiana.Zooming out:Brightmark recycles plastic by pyrolysis, which converts waste plastic (that isn't sorted or can't be mechanically recycled) into naphtha, diesel, and wax. That naphtha can then be sold to petrochemical companies as a feedstock for steam crackers.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemical company, Dow Chemical, has announced plans to reduce the emissions from its site in Terneuzen, The Netherlands, by more than 40% by 2030.How they will get started:Dow appears to operate 3 large steam crackers at this location (which we know are very emissions intensive). To reduce those emissions the company will first build a \"clean hydrogen plant\" that converts by-products from the production process into hydrogen and CO2. The hydrogen will be used as fuel and the CO2 will be captured and stored \"until alternative technologies develop\". The next phase of the project will capture and utilize CO2 from its EO production process (like we talked about last time).What will come next:While we've seen Dow vaguely speak of its desire to electrify steam crackers, this is the first time we're seeing the company pin down a location. While it's clear that the Dutch Climate Agreement prompted this announcement, it's possible that BASF and SABIC's announcement in March explains why Dow was compelled to mention the eventual use of electric steam crackers.Read the press release here.\n",

Today, the world produces some 45 million tons of the molecule each year. Most of all that production is done in the same way, at least in principle, that August Wilhelm von Hofmann came up with in the late 19th century.Typically, formaldehyde is produce by the catalytic oxidation of methanol in the Formox process. Nearly 70% of all formaldehyde production is used to make urea-, phenol-, and melamine-formaldehyde resins (aka UF, PF, and MF). The remaining 30% is most notably used to produce BDO (which becomes Spandex) and MDI (which becomes rigid foams).Some of the world's largest formaldehyde producers are Georgia-Pacific, Hexion, Dynea, BASF, and Huntsman. While the production of formaldeyde is relatively simple, it's costly to transport, so most formaldehyde is consumed where it is produced.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 US-based refining corporation, Phillips 66, has announced that it will be converting its entire refinery in San Francisco to a renewable fuels plant. Additionally, it will be shutting down its 45,000 barrel per day refinery in Santa Maria, California. Some context:By producing renewable diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel from cooking oils, greases, and soybean oil emissions from the plan will be reduced by 50%. In 2024 when the plant starts up it will produce over 2 million gallons of renewable fuel per day. That is nearly 5 times the size of the biorefinery mentioned yesterday that ExxonMobil will be buying from. This announcement comes just a week after Marathon Petroleum teased the possibility of converting one of its refineries just like this one.Anything else?The CEO of Phillips 66 says that this is a significant step \"to support demand for renewable fuels and help California meet its low carbon objectives,\". The plant is being made possible with the help of subsidies like LCFS credits, federal RIN D5 credits, and Blenders Tax Credits. In total, the subsidies generate about $3.32 a gallon in subsidies for renewable diesel producers.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Oil giant headquartered in the Netherlands, Shell, is rumored to be seeking to purchase 50% of Indian-based Nayara Energy's $9 billion petrochemical project. The project is expected to complete construction in 2025.Why would Shell want a piece?Shell reportedly signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Nayara just a month ago, which usually signals a binding agreement will come soon. Many oil majors are looking to gain traction in India due to the country's projected growth. Here's an interview about the future of petrochemicals in India.What is the $9 billion complex making?The new mega-complex will include a 1.8 million ton per year ethylene steam cracker (one of the largest ever), an aromatic complex, and another 10.75 million tons per year of other petrochemicals.Read more here on Reuters.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Specialty chemicals producer, Momentive Performance Materials, has announced its plans to shut down their basic chemicals production in favor of expanding production of electronic materials.What exactly are they doing?Over the next two years the company will elimate 30% of the employees at its Waterford, New York site as they stop producing the raw materials used to create silicone fluids, sealants, and elastomers. The change will make Dow Chemical the last producer of these chemicals in the US. So what's next?At the same time that they shut down raw material manufacturing, Momentive will be spending $15 million to expand their electronic materials production. The company already produces a wide variety of materials that have applications in advanced aerospace, 5G networks, and automotive electronics. Think of materials with high thermal conductivity, allowing heat to flow away from electronics it can damage, or sealants to make electronics waterproof.Read more here on C&EN or read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 International petrochemical company, LyondellBasell, has announced the successful start-up of its chemical recycling pilot plant at its site in Ferrara, Italy.History lesson:Just over 2 years ago LyondellBasell signed an agreement with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) to \"advance chemical recycling\". Then, this time last year, it was announced that the construction of a pilot plant was about to begin.The details:They call the technology MoReTec (molecular recycling technology) and it aims to return post-consumer plastic waste back into its molecular form. The technology has shown that the use of a novel catalyst in the pyrolysis process has made the depolymerization process faster and more energy-efficient (aka cheaper).Bigger picture:If the technology proves to be economical then it could be the holy grail of plastics recycling. LyondellBasell loves to license its technologies, so keep in mind that it doesn't have to be just them who use the new process.Read the press release here.\n",

By purchasing these two companies (that are also in the Nylon business) Ascend will now have one additional production facility in Europe and one new distribution center. This allows the company to better serve customers on a global scale.Some context:As a general rule, chemical companies owned by private equity firms tend to be more involved in M&A than their peers.

      "                                 Canadian-based battery recycling start-up, Li-Cycle, has announced that it will be building a $175 million battery materials refinery in Rochester, New York.What are they doing exactly?Li-Cycle's growth plan involves building many decentralized \"spokes\" to feed its centralized \"hubs\". At the spoke sites, the used lithium-ion batteries are shredded from an electrically charged (and dangerous) state into an inert product. Those shredded batteries are then sent to a regional hub for hydrometallurgical processing (to refine the shredded material into pure lithium, copper, nickel, manganese, and cobalt). The site being built will be Li-Cycle's very first hub.Zooming out:Just last week we saw Solvay getting in on battery recycling as well. While companies like Albemarle are working to produce lithium and battery materials from mining, we're now seeing other companies look to recycling as a way to produce those raw materials.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Headquartered in Michigan, global corporation Dow Chemical has announced the divestment of US Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations for $620 million. The sites are being sold to Royal Vopak and investment firm BlackRock.Why are they selling?Back in July, Dow announced its cost-cutting plans to get through the pandemic, and part of that meant evaluating the ownership of its non-revenue generating assets. While ownership of those assets has historically allowed Dow some cost advantages, they have already signed long-term service agreements with the terminal's new owners ensuring similar benefits.Bigger picture:Aside from cost-cutting, Dow's CEO said the sale will enable them to \"deploy cash towards value-enhancing opportunities in our core businesses\". Those businesses being commodity petrochemicals and plastics. A couple months ago Dow sold off its rail assets in a very similar fashion for the same purpose.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Finland-based oil refiner (and largest producer of renewable diesel), Neste, has announced that it will begin restructuring its Finnish refining operations.What are they planning on doing?Neste is looking at halting production at one of its refineries (but to keep using it as a harbor and distribution terminal) and upgrading another one of its refineries so that it is capable of producing renewable diesel. The changes could lead to up to 470 redundant jobs and cost savings of close to $60 million.Why are they doing this?Neste's CEO said, \"The energy transition is proceeding faster than expected. The forthcoming operating and maintenance investments in the Naantali refinery are not viable nor sustainable in a situation where there is large over-capacity for oil refining globally.\". In short, Neste does not believe that oil prices will ever recover to previous levels.Read more here on Oil & Gas Journal.\n",

      "                                 French international oil major, Total, has announced its $580 million plan to convert one of its refineries into a biofuels and circular plastics plant.The details:Total will stop refining crude oil at the site early next year and will begin the construction of 3 new units. They will be building a biorefinery (much like the one that Phillips 66 announced a couple of weeks ago). A joint venture plant between Total and Corbion to produce PLA (we talked about another PLA plant on Tuesday). And last but not least, a joint venture plant between Total and Plastic Energy to build France's first chemical recycling of plastics plant (based on pyrolysis, also mentioned two weeks ago).Why are they doing this?As much as we'd like to think that Total has decided to make this investment entirely because of its net-zero emission goals, it's a little more complicated than that. The refinery was shut down last year because of an issue with the 160-mile pipeline it relies on. The only way to resume normal operation at the refinery was to spend $700 million to replace the pipeline. So it was either that or convert the plant into this green machine.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 UK-based styrene producer, INEOS Styrolution, and AmSty have announced plans to build a polystyrene (PS) chemical recycling plant just outside of Chicago, Illinois.You should know:The plant will be licensing Agilyx's pyrolysis technology that returns polystyrene back to its styrene monomer. When it starts up it will recycle 100 tons of post-consumer waste polystyrene each day (that's a lot of styrofoam and yogurt cups).Some context:This is the second plant to use Agilyx's recycling technology—the first one was a joint venture between AmSty and Agilyx located in Tigard, Oregon. According to a VP at AmSty, \"Other plastics can also be converted into useful intermediates, but polystyrene offers a truly circular solution. Polystyrene remains the best option for a range of applications such as food and beverage containers.\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Headquartered in India, Artek Surfin Chemicals (no chemicals related to surfing), has announced that it will be acquiring a chemical manufacturing facility from Baker Hughes.What did they buy exactly?The site, located in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, employs 120 people and manufactures oilfield specialty chemicals. Baker Hughes has been a leading producer of those specialty chemicals for years (defoamers, friction reducers, corrosion inhibitors, and surfactants).Bigger picture:For Artek, the acquisition is \"another key step in our global vision and growth strategy as we continue to pursue additional strategic acquisitions such as this,\". While Artek is looking to incorporate this site into its core businesses, Baker Hughes appears to be exiting its downstream integration into chemical manufacturing. Back in July, we saw Baker sell off its polyethylene waxes business to a private equity firm.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 UK-based carbon capture start-up, Carbon8, has announced a new pilot project that will latch on to a Dutch energy from waste plant.Background on Carbon8:The start-up invented and owns a process that will combine the power, fly ash, and CO2 emissions from the plant into artificial limestone. That artificial limestone can then be used to form blocks, precast concrete, or ready mixed concrete. This makes it a carbon-negative product, and if it proves to be economical it has the potential to reduce the emission-related impacts of construction.What makes this project special?The company has deployed its technology at other types of plants, but this is the first time it will be part of a waste to energy plant. The pilot project will produce 100 tons of artificial limestone for validation and use. If all goes well Carbon8 plans on expanding commercially at this plant or somewhere else in The Netherlands.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Subsidiary of the state-owned petroleum company in Oman, OQ Chemicals, has announced the successful expansion of its isononanoic acid production capacity at its site in Oberhausen, Germany.Why do we need more of this stuff?Isononanoic acid is a key ingredient in synthetic polyol ester-based lubricants for the refrigeration industry. As new environmental regulations take hold and energy efficiency standards rise, the refrigeration industry needs higher performance lubricants. When the demand for the end product rises, the demand for the feedstocks rises.The details:The expansion project will allow OQ Chemicals to produce 30% more isononanoic acid globally. From a broader perspective, the expansion \"marks an important milestone in our long-term capacity strategy for carboxylic acids, which is based on expanding existing assets and adding production plants.\".Read the press release here.\n",

Plug Power uses 40 tons of liquid hydrogen each day as it operates over 100 customer-facing hydrogen fueling stations.So what's the deal?Plug Power recently vertically integrated into hydrogen production and has the goal of becoming the largest green hydrogen producer in the US.

      "\n",
      "                                 US-based Chevron and Phillips 66 joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical (CP Chem), has announced that it has successfully achieved commercial-scale production of polyethylene from mixed-waste plastics.The context you need:CP Chem is a major producer of ethylene, propylene, and the polymers that they become. Those critical chemicals and materials are produced by cracking natural gas from the oil and gas industry. But you don't have to crack natural gas, you could crack pyrolysis oil made from plastic waste as a solution to the plastic waste problem.What is CP Chem's role?Cracking pyrolysis oil instead of natural gas is easier said than done. It's not as simple as just switching out the feedstocks (this is where chemical engineers come in handy). CP Chem didn't offer any details about who is supplying them with the pyrolysis oil, whether the oil was blended with other feedstocks, or how much they can currently produce. But they did let us know that they want to make a billion pounds of it by 2030.Read the press release here.\n",

      "Bayer chemicals and material spin-off, Covestro, has announced the launch of a new production line of polycarbonate films in Thailand.What are they making?Polycarbonates come in plenty of different shapes and varieties (here's a primer on them here), but this new production line is transforming the material into films. Polycarbonate films are \"mainly used in the automotive, telecommunications, medical technology and ID document sectors.\".Why the new production line?This new line is Covestro's first step in expanding its film production globally. According to Covestro, the new line is important to them \"because it enables faster market launches and at the same time expands our market access in Asia-Pacific.\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Thailand-based petrochemical company, Indorama Ventures (IVL), announced plans to increase its renewable energy use to 30% by 2030 and its intentions to acquire recycling businesses globally.How they will reach that energy goal:Currently, 6% of IVL's power consumption comes from renewable sources (which is high, relatively speaking). The company plans on increasing its reliance on solar and wind power to reach that 30% mark. While some of that will come from installing solar panels at its facilities, much of it will come from buying it from renewable energy developers (like how Solvay has done it).And its recycling plans?The last time we talked about IVL was two months ago when they made some investments in Poland's recycling infrastructure. This announcement was a reminder that they are looking to spend $1.5 billion on recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It's unlikely that IVL will be the only chemical company to invest in the recycling industry, so keep an eye out for others jumping in.Read more here on Bloomberg.\n",

      "                                 Industrial gas company, Linde, has announced that it will build, own, and operate a new air separation plant for Samsung's new semiconductor plant in Pyeongtaek, South Korea.Why we need Linde:Back in 1895, Carl von Linde pioneered the cryogenic separation of air by cooling the gas into a liquid and distilling it. Today Linde (his company) uses a similar process to pull pure nitrogen, oxygen, and argon from the air. Nitrogen is typically used for inerting and purging, oxygen for deposition and etching, and argon for plasma and high-temperature inerting. We could not make electronics if it weren't for these industrial gases.Zooming out:Samsung's new $25 billion semiconductor fabrication facility is speculated to produce \"NAND, DRAM, image sensors, and handset application processors.\". As demand for electronics continues to rise, Linde and Samsung's now 42-year partnership shows no signs of coming to an end.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemicals company, Huntsman, has announced that it will be selling its India-based consumer adhesives business to Pidilite Industries for $285 million in cash.First, a little background:Back in 2003, Huntsman began its business in India through a complex set of acquisitions. Since then it has taken that \"business and built it from almost nothing to be a market leader in India.\". The consumer adhesives business produces the adhesives you know best—super glue, wood glue, multi-purpose, etc.So why the divestment?Huntsman has a small footprint in India and knows that the cash gained from the sale can be put to work elsewhere. Huntsman's CEO said the money will go towards \"growth assets that fit even better within our core Advanced Materials specialty business.\". Pidilite, a leader in the Indian consumer adhesives business, \"is in a better position to invest in and more aggressively grow\" the assets.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Dutch-based oil major, Shell, has announced that it will be further reducing its refining portfolio from 14 sites to 6 sites.Important context:Shell owned and operated 54 refineries just one decade ago. Last year, the company was down to 19 sites with the plan of further reducing that count to 10.Why are they doing this?Shell expects growth in chemicals to \"pivot to more performance chemicals and recycled feedstocks.\", so they will be fully integrating chemicals into the remaining 6 sites. That integration will allow the refineries to be less affected by the bottoms of the refining cycle. The announcement is also aligned with Shell's net-zero emissions by 2050 goal.Read the press release here.\n",

The organization made it clear that \"the vitality of [the] industry and its ability to produce these life-saving materials means maintaining access to our country’s vast shale gas resources.\".Read the full statement here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Japanese-based chemical company, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC), has announced that it will be permanently closing its methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer and methacrylic acid (MAA) production site in Beaumont, TX.Why did they do it?The company reasoned that the decision would \"boost competitiveness and optimize its supply chain in keeping with demand and supply trends for raw materials\". The decision factored in an approximately $230 million impairment loss on the facility (if you want to understand what that means try checking this out).What were they making?The nearly 200 employees at the site helped to produce about 135,000 tons of MMA and MAA per year. MMA is a raw material \"for acrylic resins used in vehicle lamp covers, signs, aquarium tanks, construction materials, [and] paints\", and MAA is a raw material \"for paints, adhesives, synthetic rubber\" and much more.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 Dutch-based oil major, Shell, has announced that it will be shutting down its refinery in Convent, Louisiana.Why shut it down?Just last week we saw that Shell was planning on reducing its refining portfolio to just six sites globally. Shell, for the sake of its employees and balance sheet, hoped that it would be able to divest the site before being forced to shut it down. Unfortunately, the company was unable to find a buyer for the site after announcing plans to sell it back in July.Bigger picture:This is the 9th refinery in the US alone that will be shut down due to the impact of COVID-19. It's expensive to start up a mothballed plant which means that if/when the plant is sold it will be sold for a low price (think of it like buying a fixer-upper).Read more here on Reuters.\n",

      "                                 US-based refiner, Phillips 66, has announced the installation of a new production unit to convert used cooking oil into low-carbon fuel at its only refinery in the UK.More on the unit:The unit, composed of \"two reactors and nearly 2,000 feet of pipework\", was built by a Belgian company nearby and rolled down the road for \"installation and commissioning\". The oversized cargo (the unit is 50 ft tall and about as heavy as The Space Shuttle) will increase the refinery's renewable diesel capacity from 1,000 barrels per day to 3,000.What are they saying?Phillips 66's lead executive in the UK added that the new unit \"highlights the refinery’s commitment and investment to further expand our production of biofuels and reinforces our reputation as the refinery of the future.\". It wasn't too long ago that the company announced it would be converting its Rodeo Refinery in California into a renewable fuels plant.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Leading chemical process technology licensor, Lummus Technology, and TCG Digital have announced the formation of a new joint venture called Lummus Digital.What the JV will do:Lummus Digital will work with Lummus' existing customers (and potential customers) to \"provide big data, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, process simulations, proprietary know-how and 24/7 advisory services\". Those customers are refining, petrochemical, and gas processing operators (for example, an operations company like Lukoil).Some context:Back in June, Lummus Technology was divested by McDermott and sold to The Chartterjee Group (TCG). TCG Digital, the other company that's part of the joint venture, is also part of The Chartterjee Group. The formation of the joint venture combines TCG Digital's capabilities with Lummus's brand name.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Advanced recycling company, Agilyx, and oil and gas giant, ExxonMobil, have announced the formation of a post-use plastic feedstock management joint venture.Some context:Agilyx created a subsidiary called Cyclyx International back in June to specialize in the recovery and sorting of plastic waste. Agilyx created the subsidiary to focus on developing \"new supply chains that will aggregate and pre-process larger volumes of post-use plastics than current systems can support.\".So how is Exxon involved?Exxon invested $8 million for a 25% stake in the subsidiary and will be given prioritized access to the plastic waste feedstock created by Cyclyx. Cyclyx hopes to collect and sort 300,000 tons of waste plastic per year by 2025 and 3 million tons per year by 2030. What Exxon has in store for that pre-processed plastic waste has yet to be announced (maybe they'll toss it in one of their steam crackers?).Read more here on ICIS.\n",

      "                                 US-based chemicals company, Trinseo, has announced that it will be acquiring Arkema's MMA and PMMA businesses for $1.24 billion.What are they buying?Over 75% of all methyl methacrylates (MMA) produced are used to make poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). PMMA \"is a transparent and rigid plastic with a wide range of end uses\" most well known by the brand name \"plexiglass\". The MMA and PMMA business being acquired employ roughly 860 people and operate seven production sites globally.Why are they buying?The acquired businesses have \"consistently delivered attractive margins with products serving many of Trinseo’s end markets\" such as \"automotive, building & construction, medical and consumer electronics.\". Trinseo is looking to transform its portfolio to become a \"higher margin, less cyclical solutions provider\". This acquisition is just the first step in that direction as the company also announced that it is looking to divest its synthetic rubber business.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 The joint venture between Total and Borealis called Baystar has announced that its new ethane cracker will come online in Q1 2021 and its HDPE unit a full year later.Some background:At the time of the JV's creation (2018) NOVA Chemicals was also a founding member (their share was acquired by Borealis in 2019). After its inception, the company began construction of a new 1 million ton per year ethane cracker in Port Arthur, Texas, and a 625,000 ton per year HDPE unit in Pasadena, Texas. The JV was created to take advantage of the US's ethane feedstock advantages.So what's the news?It turns out that the ethane cracker is on schedule, but the HDPE unit is running a little behind. The HDPE unit was initially meant to start-up sometime next year, but it has been pushed back to Q1 2022. While no reason was officially stated, we can just blame COVID-19 and call it a day.Read more here on S&P Global.\n",

      "                                 South Korean chemical company, LG Chem, has announced that its cathode active materials plant in Wuxi, China will run entirely on renewable energy starting in 2021.The details:LG Chem's plant in Wuxi combines lithium compounds (like the lithium carbonate we saw last week) with precursors (like elements such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese) to produce the cathodes used in lithium-ion batteries. Leyou New Energy Materials will be supplying energy from wind and solar sources to LG Chem's plant—effetively reducing production-related emissions by 100,000 tons of CO2 per year.Bigger picture:It's true that EVs have less associated emissions over their life-span than traditional vehicles. But if the objective is to make transportation emissions-free, then the entire supply chain to make the EV has to be emissions-free. LG Chem is looking to tackle the emissions associated with the battery materials that make EVs possible.Read more here on Korea Herald.\n",

      "                                 Japanese-based chemical company, Sumitomo Chemical, has selected Axens' ethanol-to-ethylene process technology for its waste-to-polyolefins project in Japan.What are the plans?First Sumitomo is partnering up with Sekisui Chemical and LanzaTech to convert waste into ethanol (by fermenting syngas). That ethanol will then be dehydrated into ethylene using Axens' technology. Ethanol dehydration as a means to ethylene production isn't new... Braskem has been doing it for a decade.Zooming out:Polyolefins (like HDPE, LDPE, and PP) are made by polymerizing olefins (like ethylene and propylene). Those olefins are typically produced by the steam cracking of natural gas (especially in the US). Many countries, like Japan, don't have the same olefin feedstock advantages—which makes waste-to-polyolefins projects like this one more economically attractive.Read the press release here.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                 US-based oil and gas giant, ExxonMobil, has announced its new emission reduction plans for the next decade.What are those plans?Exxon plans on reducing upstream emissions intensity by 15-20%, methane emission intensity by 40-50%, and flaring emissions intensity by 35-45%. The company also announced that it expects to achieve its 2018 goals of a 15% decrease in methane emissions and a 25% reduction in flaring by the end of 2020.The fine print:While Exxon's emission goals are in line with the energy transition, reducing emissions (total emissions) and reducing emissions intensity (emissions per barrel of oil produced) are not the same thing. The subtle difference means total emissions can rise while intensity falls, and that's what separates Exxon's plans from its European competitors (Shell, BP, Equinor, etc.). Exxon is taking the intensity angle because it doesn't expect renewable sources to be enough to supply the world in 2040.Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Italian EPC group, Maire Technimont, has announced that it was selected by IndianOil to build its new acrylic acid and butyl acrylate units in Dumad, India.The details:IndianOil is paying Maire Technimont $255 million to handle all of the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning activities. The 90,000 ton per year acrylic acid unit and the 150,000 ton per year butyl acrylate unit are expected to be operational in about two years.Zooming out:The propylene feedstock needed to produce acrylic acid will be provided by IndianOil's nearby refinery. All of that acrylic acid will be used to produce butyl acrylate—which will be used in paints, coatings, textiles, plastics, and adhesives. IndianOil is building the plant because India lacks butyl acrylate producers and demand for the chemical is expected to increase (because of increased construction in India).Read the press release here.\n",

Just a couple of years ago INEOS acquired a polystyrene site in Ningbo from Total. The construction of the new ABS plant at this site \"affirms [the company's] commitment to support the growth of [its] customers in Asia\".Read the press release here.\n",

      "                                 Japanese chemical company, Sumitomo Chemical, has announced that it's looking to combine propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with a new CO2 utilization technology.Some context:Because of all the new ethane crackers (which don't produce as much propylene as naphtha crackers) the world has relatively less propylene in the market. To account for that propane dehydrogenation units (which make propylene) have become more common, but the units produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide as by-products.So what do they want to do?In order to reduce emissions (and make money) Sumitomo wants to produce methanol from that hydrogen and carbon dioxide. That's a lot easier said than done, as hydrogenating carbon dioxide is no simple task. With help from Shimane University, Sumitomo is hoping to come up with a viable solution.Read the press release here.\n",

      "ORLEN Unipetrol has commissioned a pyrolytic testing unit for waste-plastics processing at its chemical plant in Litvínov. It will explore the possibilities of chemical plastic recycling and its potential implementation in standard production in the next three years. By introducing circular economy principles into production processes, the largest petrochemical group in the Czech Republic wants to expand the conventional fuel and plastic production from fossil fuels with new sources that will lead to the decarbonisation of the Czech Republic and compliance with EU policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, more than 400,000 tonnes of plastic waste are produced annually in the Czech Republic. Of this amount, approximately 37% of waste plastics are used for recycling, and 18% are used as energy for heat and/or electricity generation. \n",
      "“Almost half the plastic waste produced in the Czech Republic remains unused now, as plastics recycling is a demanding process. The chemical recycling technology that we are testing can change this,” said Tomasz Wiatrak, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the ORLEN Unipetrol Group. He added: “Who else but our petrochemical group, one of the pillars of the Czech economy, should be trying to find new solutions and ways forward. By applying the circular economy principles, we contribute to developing a competitive and ecological future of the Czech Republic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As a traditional petrochemical manufacturer, ORLEN Unipetrol supplies fuels and plastic products for everyday needs to the Czech and Central European markets. They are made of crude oil imported from all over the world. Recently, the company has been trying to include other input resources into production, mainly such that have been considered waste materials up to now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Chemical recycling that uses the principles of pyrolysis – thermal decomposition under elevated temperatures – seems to be a highly effective technology for repeated use of waste plastics. The original waste is highly yielded and transformed into hydrocarbons that can be reintegrated into petrochemical production. This makes the use of existing plastic waste more effective and the carbon footprint significantly lower,” said Tomáš Herink, member of the Board of Directors of the ORLEN Unipetrol Group responsible for production, research and development. He adds: “Our ambition is to chemically recycle waste plastics from our nearest surroundings and the entire Czech Republic within several years.” \n",
      "\n",
      "The project’s output will be a comprehensive proposal of a technology on an industrial scale based on pyrolysis to process waste plastics and rubber from tyres whose products may be used in the petrochemical industry to manufacture basic chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, butadiene, and benzene. Using subsequent processes, they will then be used to manufacture final petrochemical products – polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc. In the refining industry, pyrolytic products will be added to the existing processed raw materials to increase the production of motor fuels, i.e., petrol and diesel fuel.\n",
      "\n",
      "ORLEN Unipetrol is collaborating on this research project with the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague and the ORLEN Unipetrol Centre for Research and Education. The costs of acquiring the testing technology amounted to CZK 18 million. They were covered from a contribution from the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic that allocated nearly CZK 7 million from the Operational Programme Enterprise and Innovations for Competitiveness. The costs of the actual research project totalled almost CZK 72 million. The Technology Agency of the Czech Republic contributed CZK 50 million from the TREND subsidy programme.  \n",
